some ailerons that produces a force which assists the pilot 
in holding the ailerons deflected. The balance panel divides 
a chamber ahead of the aileron in such a way that when the

Blush. A defect in a lacquer or dope finish caused by moisture 
condensing on the surface before the finish dries. If the 
humidity of the air is high, the evaporation of the solvents 
cools the air enough to cause the moisture to condense. The 
water condensed from the air mixes with the lacquer or dope 
and forms a dull, porous, chalky-looking finish called blush. 
A blushed finish is neither attractive nor protective.

Bonding. The process of electrically connecting all isolated 
components to the aircraft structure. Bonding provides a 
path for return current from electrical components, and a 
low-impedance path to ground to minimize static electrical 
charges. Shock-mounted components have bonding braids 
connected across the shock mounts.

Boost pump. An electrically driven centrifugal pump 
mounted in the bottom of the fuel tanks in large aircraft. Boost 
pumps provide a positive flow of fuel under pressure to the 
engine for starting and serve as an emergency backup in the 
event an engine-driven pump should fail. They are also used 
to transfer fuel from one tank to another and to pump fuel 
overboard when it is being dumped. Boost pumps prevent 
vapor locks by holding pressure on the fuel in the line to the 
engine-driven pump. Centrifugal boost pumps have a small 
agitator propeller on top of the impeller to force vapors from 
the fuel before it leaves the tank.

measuring the vapor pressure in a sealed container of a 
volatile liquid, such as methyl chloride, whose vapor pressure 
varies directly with its temperature.

popular type of electronic fuel quantity indicating system 
that has no moving parts in the fuel tank. The tank units are 
cylindrical capacitors, called probes, mounted across the 
tank, from top to bottom. The dielectric between the plates 
of the probes is either fuel or the air above the fuel, and the 
capacitance of the probe varies with the amount of fuel in 
the tank. The indicator is a servo-type instrument driven by 
the amplified output of a capacitance bridge.

When the brake is applied, the master-cylinder piston covers 
the compensator port and allows pressure in the line to the 
brake to build up and apply the brakes. When the brake is 
released, the piston uncovers the compensator port. If any 
fluid has been lost from the brake, the reservoir will refill 
the master cylinder. A restricted compensator port will cause

System-pressure regulator (hydraulic system component). 
A type of hydraulic system-pressure control valve. When the 
system pressure is low, as it is when some unit is actuated, 
the output of the constant-delivery pump is directed into the 
system. When the actuation is completed and the pressure

unloaded and its output is directed back into the reservoir 
with very little opposition. The pump output pressure drops, 
but the volume of flow remains the same. When the system 
pressure drops to the specified kick-in pressure, the regulator

Aircraft Structures
A Brief History of Aircraft Structures
The history of aircraft structures underlies the history of 
aviation in general. Advances in materials and processes 
used to construct aircraft have led to their evolution from 
simple wood truss structures to the sleek aerodynamic flying 
machines of today. Combined with continuous powerplant 
development, the structures of “flying machines” have 
changed significantly.

The key discovery that “lift” could be created by passing 
air over the top of a curved surface set the development of 
fixed and rotary-wing aircraft in motion. George Cayley 
developed an efficient cambered airfoil in the early 1800s, 
as well as successful manned gliders later in that century. He 
established the principles of flight, including the existence of 
lift, weight, thrust, and drag. It was Cayley who first stacked 
wings and created a tri-wing glider that flew a man in 1853.

flying replica of his 1853 glider (bottom).

Figure 1-2. Master of gliding and wing study, Otto Lilienthal (top) 
and one of his more than 2,000 glider flights (bottom)

Earlier, Cayley studied the center of gravity of flying 
machines, as well as the effects of wing dihedral. Furthermore, 
he pioneered directional control of aircraft by including the 
earliest form of a rudder on his gliders. [Figure 1-1]

In the late 1800s, Otto Lilienthal built upon Cayley’s 
discoveries. He manufactured and flew his own gliders 
on over 2,000 flights. His willow and cloth aircraft had 
wings designed from extensive study of the wings of birds. 
Lilienthal also made standard use of vertical and horizontal 
fins behind the wings and pilot station. Above all, Lilienthal 
proved that man could fly. [Figure 1-2]

Octave Chanute, a retired railroad and bridge engineer, 
was active in aviation during the 1890s. [Figure 1-3] His 
interest was so great that, among other things, he published 
a definitive work called “Progress in Flying Machines.” This 
was the culmination of his effort to gather and study all the  

information available on aviation. With the assistance of 
others, he built gliders similar to Lilienthal’s and then his 
own. In addition to his publication, Chanute advanced aircraft 
structure development by building a glider with stacked wings 
incorporating the use of wires as wing supports. 

The work of all of these men was known to the Wright 
Brothers when they built their successful, powered airplane 
in 1903. The first of its kind to carry a man aloft, the Wright 
Flyer had thin, cloth-covered wings attached to what was 
primarily truss structures made of wood. The wings contained 
forward and rear spars and were supported with both struts 
and wires. Stacked wings (two sets) were also part of the 
Wright Flyer. [Figure 1-4] 


1-3

Figure 1-3. Octave Chanute gathered and published all of the 
aeronautical knowledge known to date in the late 1890s. Many 
early aviators benefited from this knowledge.

Figure 1-5. The world’s first mono-wing by Louis Bleriot. 

Figure 1-4. The Wright Flyer was the first successful powered aircraft. It was made primarily of wood and fabric.

Powered heavier-than-air aviation grew from the Wright 
design. Inventors and fledgling aviators began building their 
own aircraft. Early on, many were similar to that constructed 
by the Wrights using wood and fabric with wires and struts 
to support the wing structure. In 1909, Frenchman Louis 
Bleriot produced an aircraft with notable design differences. 
He built a successful mono-wing aircraft. The wings were 

still supported by wires, but a mast extending above the 
fuselage enabled the wings to be supported from above, as 
well as underneath. This made possible the extended wing 
length needed to lift an aircraft with a single set of wings. 
Bleriot used a Pratt truss-type fuselage frame. [Figure 1-5]

More powerful engines were developed, and airframe 
structures changed to take advantage of the benefits. As 
early as 1910, German Hugo Junkers was able to build an 
aircraft with metal truss construction and metal skin due to 
the availability of stronger powerplants to thrust the plane 
forward and into the sky. The use of metal instead of wood 
for the primary structure eliminated the need for external 
wing braces and wires. His J-1 also had a single set of wings 
(a monoplane) instead of a stacked set. [Figure 1-6]

Figure 1-7. World War I aircraft were typically stacked-wing fabric-
covered aircraft like this Breguet 14 (circa 1917).

Figure 1-8. The flying boat hull was an early semimonocoque design 
like this Curtiss HS-2L. 

Leading up to World War I (WWI), stronger engines also 
allowed designers to develop thicker wings with stronger 
spars. Wire wing bracing was no longer needed. Flatter, lower 
wing surfaces on high-camber wings created more lift. WWI 
expanded the need for large quantities of reliable aircraft. 
Used mostly for reconnaissance, stacked-wing tail draggers 
with wood and metal truss frames with mostly fabric skin 
dominated the wartime sky. [Figure 1-7] The Red Baron’s 
Fokker DR-1 was typical. 

In the 1920s, the use of metal in aircraft construction 
increased. Fuselages able to carry cargo and passengers 
were developed. The early flying boats with their hull-type 
construction from the shipbuilding industry provided the 
blueprints for semimonocoque construction of fuselages. 
[Figure 1-8] Truss-type designs faded. A tendency toward 
cleaner mono-wing designs prevailed.
 
Into the 1930s, all-metal aircraft accompanied new lighter and 
more powerful engines. Larger semimonocoque fuselages 
were complimented with stress-skin wing designs. Fewer 
truss and fabric aircraft were built. World War II (WWII) 
brought about a myriad of aircraft designs using all metal 
technology. Deep fuel-carrying wings were the norm, but the 
desire for higher flight speeds prompted the development of 
thin-winged aircraft in which fuel was carried in the fuselage. 
The first composite structure aircraft, the De Havilland 
Mosquito, used a balsa wood sandwich material in the  

construction of the fuselage. [Figure 1-9] The fiberglass 
radome was also developed during this period.

After WWII, the development of turbine engines led to 
higher altitude flight. The need for pressurized aircraft 
pervaded aviation. Semimonocoque construction needed 
to be made even stronger as a result. Refinements to the 
all-metal semimonocoque fuselage structure were made to 
increase strength and combat metal fatigue caused by the 
pressurization-depressurization cycle. Rounded window 
and door openings were developed to avoid weak areas 
where cracks could form. Integrally machined copper 
alloy aluminum skin resisted cracking and allowed thicker 
skin and controlled tapering. Chemical milling of wing 
skin structures provided great strength and smooth high-

performance surfaces. Variable contour wings became easier  
to construct. Increases in flight speed accompanying jet travel 
brought about the need for thinner wings. Wing loading also 
increased greatly. Multispar and box beam wing designs were 
developed in response.

In the 1960s, ever larger aircraft were developed to carry 
passengers. As engine technology improved, the jumbo jet 
was engineered and built. Still primarily aluminum with a 
semimonocoque fuselage, the sheer size of the airliners of 
the day initiated a search for lighter and stronger materials 
from which to build them. The use of honeycomb constructed 
panels in Boeing’s airline series saved weight while not 
compromising strength. Initially, aluminum core with 
aluminum or fiberglass skin sandwich panels were used on 
wing panels, flight control surfaces, cabin floor boards, and 
other applications. 

A steady increase in the use of honeycomb and foam core 
sandwich components and a wide variety of composite 
materials characterizes the state of aviation structures from 
the 1970s to the present. Advanced techniques and material 
combinations have resulted in a gradual shift from aluminum 
to carbon fiber and other strong, lightweight materials. These 
new materials are engineered to meet specific performance 
requirements for various components on the aircraft. Many 
airframe structures are made of more than 50 percent 
advanced composites, with some airframes approaching 
100 percent. The term “very light jet” (VLJ) has come to 
describe a new generation of jet aircraft made almost entirely 
of advanced composite materials. [Figure 1-10] It is possible 
that noncomposite aluminum aircraft structures will become 
obsolete as did the methods and materials of construction 
used by Cayley, Lilienthal, and the Wright Brothers. 

General
An aircraft is a device that is used for, or is intended to be used 
for, flight in the air. Major categories of aircraft are airplane, 
rotorcraft, glider, and lighter-than-air vehicles. [Figure 1-11] 
Each of these may be divided further by major distinguishing 
features of the aircraft, such as airships and balloons. Both 
are lighter-than-air aircraft but have differentiating features 
and are operated differently.

The concentration of this handbook is on the airframe of 
aircraft; specifically, the fuselage, booms, nacelles, cowlings, 
fairings, airfoil surfaces, and landing gear. Also included are 
the various accessories and controls that accompany these 
structures. Note that the rotors of a helicopter are considered 
part of the airframe since they are actually rotating wings. 
By contrast, propellers and rotating airfoils of an engine on 
an airplane are not considered part of the airframe.
 
The most common aircraft is the fixed-wing aircraft. As 
the name implies, the wings on this type of flying machine 
are attached to the fuselage and are not intended to move 
independently in a fashion that results in the creation of lift. 
One, two, or three sets of wings have all been successfully 
utilized. [Figure 1-12] Rotary-wing aircraft such as 
helicopters are also widespread. This handbook discusses 
features and maintenance aspects common to both fixed-
wing and rotary-wing categories of aircraft. Also, in certain 
cases, explanations focus on information specific to only 
one or the other. Glider airframes are very similar to fixed-
wing aircraft. Unless otherwise noted, maintenance practices 
described for fixed-wing aircraft also apply to gliders. The 
same is true for lighter-than-air aircraft, although thorough

aircraft (bottom).

coverage of the unique airframe structures and maintenance 
practices for lighter-than-air flying machines is not included 
in this handbook.

The airframe of a fixed-wing aircraft consists of five principal 
units: the fuselage, wings, stabilizers, flight control surfaces, 
and landing gear. [Figure 1-13] Helicopter airframes consist 
of the fuselage, main rotor and related gearbox, tail rotor (on 
helicopters with a single main rotor), and the landing gear.

Airframe structural components are constructed from a wide 
variety of materials. The earliest aircraft were constructed 
primarily of wood. Steel tubing and the most common 
material, aluminum, followed. Many newly certified aircraft 
are built from molded composite materials, such as carbon 
fiber. Structural members of an aircraft’s fuselage include 
stringers, longerons, ribs, bulkheads, and more. The main 
structural member in a wing is called the wing spar. 

The skin of aircraft can also be made from a variety of 
materials, ranging from impregnated fabric to plywood, 
aluminum, or composites. Under the skin and attached to 
the structural fuselage are the many components that support 
airframe function. The entire airframe and its components are 
joined by rivets, bolts, screws, and other fasteners. Welding, 
adhesives, and special bonding techniques are also used.

Major Structural Stresses
Aircraft structural members are designed to carry a load or 
to resist stress. In designing an aircraft, every square inch of 
wing and fuselage, every rib, spar, and even each metal fitting 
must be considered in relation to the physical characteristics 
of the material of which it is made. Every part of the aircraft 
must be planned to carry the load to be imposed upon it.

The determi nation of such loads is called stress analysis. 
Although planning the design is not the function of the aircraft 
technician, it is, nevertheless, important that the technician 
understand and appreciate the stresses in volved in order to 
avoid changes in the original design through improper repairs.

The term “stress” is often used interchangeably with the 
word “strain.” While related, they are not the same thing. 
External loads or forces cause stress. Stress is a material’s 
internal resistance, or counterforce, that opposes deformation. 
The degree of deformation of a material is strain. When 
a material is subjected to a load or force, that material is 
deformed, regardless of how strong the material is or how 
light the load is.

There are five major stresses [Figure 1-14] to which all 
aircraft are subjected: 

• Tension

• Compression

• Torsion

• Shear

• Bending

Tension is the stress that resists a force that tends to pull 
something apart. [Figure 1-14A] The engine pulls the aircraft 

forward, but air resistance tries to hold it back. The result is 
tension, which stretches the aircraft. The tensile strength of 
a material is measured in pounds per square inch (psi) and is 
calculated by dividing the load (in pounds) re quired to pull the 
material apart by its cross-sec tional area (in square inches).

Compression is the stress that res ists a crushing force. 
[Figure 1-14B] The compressive strength of a material is 
also measured in psi. Compression is the stress that tends to 
shorten or squeeze aircraft parts.

Torsion is the stress that produces twisting. [Figure 1-14C] 
While moving the aircraft forward, the en gine also tends to 
twist it to one side, but other aircraft components hold it on 
course. Thus, torsion is created. The torsion strength of a 
material is its resistance to twisting or torque.

Shear is the stress that resists the force tending to cause 
one layer of a material to slide over an adjacent layer. 
[Figure 1-14D] Two riveted plates in tension subject the 
rivets to a shearing force. Usually, the shearing strength 
of a material is either equal to or less than its tensile or 
compressive strength. Aircraft parts, especially screws, bolts, 
and rivets, are often subject to a shearing force.

Bending stress is a combination of compression and tension.

A single member of the structure may be subjected to 
a combination of stresses. In most cases, the struc tural 
members are designed to carry end loads rather than side 
loads. They are designed to be subjected to tension or 
compression rather than bending. 

Strength or resistance to the external loads imposed during 
operation may be the principal requirement in cer tain 
structures. However, there are numerous other characteristics 
in addition to designing to control the five major stresses that 
engineers must consider. For example, cowling, fairings, and 
simi lar parts may not be subject to significant loads requiring 
a high degree of strength. However, these parts must have 
streamlined shapes to meet aerodynamic requirements, such 
as reducing drag or directing airflow.

Fixed-Wing Aircraft
Fuselage
The fuselage is the main structure or body of the fixed-wing 
aircraft. It provides space for cargo, controls, acces sories, 
passengers, and other equipment. In single-engine aircraft, 
the fuselage houses the powerplant. In multiengine aircraft, 
the engines may be either in the fuselage, attached to the 
fuselage, or suspended from the wing structure. There are two 
general types of fuselage construc tion: truss and monocoque.

Truss-Type
A truss is a rigid framework made up of members, such as 
beams, struts, and bars to resist deforma tion by applied loads. 
The truss-framed fuselage is generally covered with fabric. 
The truss-type fuselage frame is usually constructed of steel

tubing welded together in such a manner that all members 
of the truss can carry both tension and compression loads. 
[Figure 1-15] In some aircraft, principally the light, single-
engine models, truss fuselage frames may be constructed of 
aluminum alloy and may be riveted or bolted into one piece, 
with cross-bracing achieved by using solid rods or tubes.

Monocoque Type
The monocoque (single shell) fuselage relies largely on the 
strength of the skin or covering to carry the primary loads. 
The design may be di vided into two classes: 

1. Monocoque

2.  Semi monocoque

Different por tions of the same fuselage may belong to either 
of the two classes, but most modern aircraft are considered 
to be of semimonocoque type construction. 
 
The true monocoque construction uses formers, frame 
assemblies, and bulkheads to give shape to the fuselage. 
[Figure 1-16] The heaviest of these structural members are 
located at intervals to carry concentrated loads and at points 
where fittings are used to attach other units such as wings, 
powerplants, and stabilizers. Since no other bracing members 
are present, the skin must carry the primary stresses and 
keep the fuselage rigid. Thus, the biggest problem involved 
in mono coque construction is maintaining enough strength 
while keeping the weight within allowable limits.

Semimonocoque Type
To overcome the strength/weight problem of monocoque 
construction, a modification called semi monocoque 
construction was devel oped. It also consists of frame 
assemblies, bulkheads, and formers as used in the monocoque 
design but, additionally, the skin is reinforced by longitudinal 

members called longerons. Longerons usually extend across 
several frame members and help the skin support primary 
bending loads. They are typically made of aluminum alloy 
either of a single piece or a built-up construction.

Stringers are also used in the semimonocoque fuselage. These 
longitudinal members are typically more numerous and lighter 
in weight than the longerons. They come in a variety of shapes 
and are usually made from single piece aluminum alloy 
extrusions or formed aluminum. Stringers have some rigidity 
but are chiefly used for giving shape and for attachment of 
the skin. Stringers and longerons together prevent tension 
and compression from bending the fuselage. [Figure 1-17]


1-10

Figure 1-18. Gussets are used to increase strength.

Other bracing between the longerons and stringers can also 
be used. Often referred to as web members, these additional 
support pieces may be installed vertically or diagonally. It 
must be noted that manufacturers use different nomenclature 
to describe structural members. For example, there is often 
little difference between some rings, frames, and formers. 
One manufacturer may call the same type of brace a ring or 
a frame. Manufacturer instructions and specifications for a 
specific aircraft are the best guides.

The semimonocoque fuselage is constructed primarily of alloys 
of aluminum and magnesium, although steel and titanium are 
sometimes found in areas of high temperatures. Individually, 
not one of the aforementioned components is strong enough 
to carry the loads imposed during flight and landing. But, 
when combined, those components form a strong, rigid 
framework. This is accomplished with gussets, rivets, nuts 
and bolts, screws, and even friction stir welding. A gusset is 
a type of connection bracket that adds strength. [Figure 1-18] 

To summarize, in semimonocoque fuselages, the strong, 
heavy longerons hold the bulkheads and formers, and these, 
in turn, hold the stringers, braces, web members, etc. All are 
designed to be attached together and to the skin to achieve 
the full-strength benefits of semimonocoque design. It is 
important to recognize that the metal skin or covering carries 
part of the load. The fuselage skin thickness can vary with the 
load carried and the stresses sustained at a particular location. 

The advantages of the semimonocoque fuselage are many. 
The bulkheads, frames, stringers, and longerons facilitate the 
de sign and construction of a streamlined fuselage that is both 
rigid and strong. Spreading loads among these structures and 
the skin means no single piece is failure critical. This means 
that a semimonocoque fuselage, because of its stressed-skin 
construction, may with stand considerable damage and still 
be strong enough to hold together.

Fuselages are generally constructed in two or more sections. 
On small aircraft, they are generally made in two or three 
sections, while larger aircraft may be made up of as many as 
six sections or more before being assembled.

Pressurization 
Many aircraft are pressurized. This means that air is pumped 
into the cabin after takeoff and a difference in pressure 
between the air inside the cabin and the air outside the cabin is 
established. This differential is regulated and maintained. In 
this manner, enough oxygen is made available for passengers 
to breathe normally and move around the cabin without 
special equipment at high altitudes. 

Pressurization causes significant stress on the fuselage 
structure and adds to the complexity of design. In addition 
to withstanding the difference in pressure between the air 
inside and outside the cabin, cycling from unpressurized to 
pressurized and back again each flight causes metal fatigue. 
To deal with these impacts and the other stresses of flight, 
nearly all pressurized aircraft are semimonocoque in design. 
Pressurized fuselage structures undergo extensive periodic 
inspections to ensure that any damage is discovered and 
repaired. Repeated weakness or failure in an area of structure 
may require that section of the fuselage be modified or 
redesigned.

Wings
Wing Configurations
Wings are airfoils that, when moved rapidly through the 
air, create lift. They are built in many shapes and sizes. 
Wing design can vary to provide certain desirable flight 
characteristics. Control at various operating speeds, the 
amount of lift generated, balance, and stability all change as 
the shape of the wing is altered. Both the leading edge and 
the trailing edge of the wing may be straight or curved, or 
one edge may be straight and the other curved. One or both 
edges may be tapered so that the wing is narrower at the tip 
than at the root where it joins the fuselage. The wing tip may 
be square, rounded, or even pointed. Figure 1-19 shows a 
number of typical wing leading and trailing edge shapes.

The wings of an aircraft can be attached to the fuselage at 
the top, mid-fuselage, or at the bottom. They may extend 
perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the fuselage or can 
angle up or down slightly. This angle is known as the wing 
dihedral. The dihedral angle affects the lateral stability of 
the aircraft. Figure 1-20 shows some common wing attach 
points and dihedral angle.

Wing Structure
The wings of an aircraft are designed to lift it into the air. 
Their particular design for any given aircraft depends on a 
number of factors, such as size, weight, use of the aircraft, 
desired speed in flight and at landing, and desired rate of 
climb. The wings of aircraft are designated left and right, 
corresponding to the left and right sides of the operator when 
seated in the cockpit. [Figure 1-21]

Often wings are of full cantilever design. This means they 
are built so that no external bracing is needed. They are 
supported internally by structural members assisted by the 
skin of the aircraft. Other aircraft wings use external struts 
or wires to assist in supporting the wing and carrying the 
aerodynamic and landing loads. Wing support cables and 
struts are generally made from steel. Many struts and their

bulkheads running chordwise (leading edge to trailing edge). 
The spars are the principle structural members of a wing. 
They support all distributed loads, as well as concentrated 
weights such as the fuselage, landing gear, and engines. The 
skin, which is attached to the wing structure, carries part of 
the loads imposed during flight. It also transfers the stresses 
to the wing ribs. The ribs, in turn, transfer the loads to the 
wing spars. [Figure 1-23]

In general, wing construction is based on one of three 
fundamental designs: 

1. Monospar

2. Multispar

3. Box beam

Modification of these basic designs may be adopted by 
various manufacturers.

The monospar wing incorporates only one main spanwise or 
longitudinal member in its construction. Ribs or bulkheads 

attach fittings have fairings to reduce drag. Short, nearly 
vertical supports called jury struts are found on struts that 
attach to the wings a great distance from the fuselage. This 
serves to subdue strut movement and oscillation caused by 
the air flowing around the strut in flight. Figure 1-22 shows 
samples of wings using external bracing, also known as 
semicantilever wings. Cantilever wings built with no external 
bracing are also shown.
 
Aluminum is the most common material from which 
to construct wings, but they can be wood covered with 
fabric, and occasionally a magnesium alloy has been used. 
Moreover, modern aircraft are tending toward lighter and 
stronger materials throughout the airframe and in wing 
construction. Wings made entirely of carbon fiber or other 
composite materials exist, as well as wings made of a 
combination of materials for maximum strength to weight 
performance. 

The internal structures of most wings are made up of spars 
and stringers running spanwise and ribs and formers or

supply the necessary contour or shape to the airfoil. Although 
the strict monospar wing is not common, this type of design 
modified by the addition of false spars or light shear webs 
along the trailing edge for support of control surfaces is 
sometimes used.

The multispar wing incorporates more than one main 
longitudinal member in its construction. To give the wing 
contour, ribs or bulkheads are often included.

The box beam type of wing construction uses two main 
longitudinal members with connecting bulkheads to 
furnish additional strength and to give contour to the wing. 
[Figure 1-24] A corrugated sheet may be placed between 
the bulkheads and the smooth outer skin so that the wing 
can better carry tension and compression loads. In some 
cases, heavy longitudinal stiffeners are substituted for the 
upper surface of the wing and stiffeners on the lower surface 

corrugated sheets. A combination of corrugated sheets on the 
upper surface of the wing and stiffeners on the lower surface 
is sometimes used. Air transport category aircraft often utilize 
box beam wing construction. 

Wing Spars
Spars are the principal structural members of the wing. They 
correspond to the longerons of the fuse lage. They run parallel 
to the lateral axis of the aircraft, from the fuselage toward 
the tip of the wing, and are usually attached to the fuselage 
by wing fittings, plain beams, or a truss.

Spars may be made of metal, wood, or composite materials 
depending on the design criteria of a specific aircraft. 
Wooden spars are usually made from spruce. They can be 
generally classified into four different types by their cross-
sectional configu ration. As shown in Figure 1-25, they may 
be (A) solid, (B) box-shaped, (C) partly hollow, or (D) in

the form of an I-beam. Lamination of solid wood spars is  
often used to increase strength. Laminated wood can also be 
found in box-shaped spars. The spar in Figure 1-25E has had 
material removed to reduce weight but retains the strength 
of a rectangular spar. As can be seen, most wing spars are 
basically rectangular in shape with the long dimension of the 
cross-section oriented up and down in the wing. 

Currently, most manufactured aircraft have wing spars 
made of solid extruded aluminum or aluminum extrusions 
riveted together to form the spar. The increased use of 
composites and the combining of materials should make 
airmen vigilant for wings spars made from a variety of 
materials. Figure 1-26 shows examples of metal wing spar 
cross-sections. 

In an I–beam spar, the top and bottom of the I–beam are 
called the caps and the vertical section is called the web. 
The entire spar can be extruded from one piece of metal 
but often it is built up from multiple extrusions or formed 
angles. The web forms the principal depth portion of the 
spar and the cap strips (extrusions, formed angles, or milled 
sections) are attached to it. Together, these members carry 

the loads caused by wing bending, with the caps providing a  
foundation for attaching the skin. Although the spar shapes 
in Figure 1-26 are typi cal, actual wing spar configura tions 
assume many forms. For example, the web of a spar may be 
a plate or a truss as shown in Figure 1-27. It could be built up 
from lightweight materials with vertical stiffeners employed 
for strength. [Figure 1-28] 

It could also have no stiffeners but might contain flanged 
holes for reducing weight but maintaining strength. Some 
metal and composite wing spars retain the I-beam concept 
but use a sine wave web. [Figure 1-29]

Additionally, fail-safe spar web design exists. Fail-safe 
means that should one member of a complex structure fail, 
some other part of the structure assumes the load of the failed 
member and permits continued operation. A spar with fail-
safe construction is shown in Figure 1-30. This spar is made 
in two sections. The top section consists of a cap riveted to 
the upper web plate. The lower section is a single extrusion 
consisting of the lower cap and web plate. These two sections 
are spliced together to form the spar. If either section of this

type of spar breaks, the other section can still carry the load. 
This is the fail-safe feature.

As a rule, a wing has two spars. One spar is usually located 
near the front of the wing, and the other about two-thirds of 
the distance toward the wing’s trailing edge. Regardless of 
type, the spar is the most important part of the wing. When 

other structural members of the wing are placed under load, 
most of the resulting stress is passed on to the wing spar.

False spars are commonly used in wing design. They are 
longitudinal members like spars but do not extend the entire 
spanwise length of the wing. Often, they are used as hinge 
attach points for control surfaces, such as an aileron spar.

Wing Ribs
Ribs are the structural crosspieces that combine with spars 
and stringers to make up the framework of the wing. They 
usually extend from the wing leading edge to the rear spar 
or to the trailing edge of the wing. The ribs give the wing 
its cambered shape and transmit the load from the skin and 
stringers to the spars. Similar ribs are also used in ailerons, 
elevators, rudders, and stabilizers. 

Wing ribs are usually manufactured from either wood or 
metal. Aircraft with wood wing spars may have wood or 
metal ribs while most aircraft with metal spars have metal 
ribs. Wood ribs are usually manufactured from spruce. The 
three most common types of wooden ribs are the plywood 
web, the lightened plywood web, and the truss types. Of these 
three, the truss type is the most efficient because it is strong 
and lightweight, but it is also the most complex to construct. 

Figure 1-31 shows wood truss web ribs and a lightened 
plywood web rib. Wood ribs have a rib cap or cap strip 
fastened around the entire perimeter of the rib. It is usually 
made of the same material as the rib itself. The rib cap stiffens 
and strengthens the rib and provides an attaching surface 
for the wing covering. In Figure 1-31A, the cross-section 
of a wing rib with a truss-type web is illustrated. The dark 
rectangular sections are the front and rear wing spars. Note that 
to reinforce the truss, gussets are used. In Figure 1-31B, a truss 
web rib is shown with a continuous gusset. It provides greater 
support throughout the entire rib with very little additional

weight. A continuous gusset stiffens the cap strip in the plane 
of the rib. This aids in preventing buckling and helps to obtain 
better rib/skin joints where nail-gluing is used. Such a rib can 
resist the driving force of nails better than the other types.  
Continuous gussets are also more easily handled than the many 
small separate gussets otherwise required. Figure 1-31C shows 
a rib with a lighten plywood web. It also contains gussets to 
support the web/cap strip interface. The cap strip is usually 
laminated to the web, especially at the leading edge.

A wing rib may also be referred to as a plain rib or a main rib. 
Wing ribs with specialized locations or functions are given 

names that reflect their uniqueness. For example, ribs that 
are located entirely forward of the front spar that are used to 
shape and strengthen the wing leading edge are called nose 
ribs or false ribs. False ribs are ribs that do not span the entire 
wing chord, which is the distance from the leading edge to 
the trailing edge of the wing. Wing butt ribs may be found 
at the inboard edge of the wing where the wing attaches 
to the fuselage. Depending on its location and method of 
attachment, a butt rib may also be called a bulkhead rib or 
a compression rib if it is designed to receive compression 
loads that tend to force the wing spars together. 

Since the ribs are laterally weak, they are strengthened in some 
wings by tapes that are woven above and below rib sections 
to prevent sidewise bending of the ribs. Drag and anti-drag 
wires may also be found in a wing. In Figure 1-32, they are 
shown criss crossed between the spars to form a truss to resist 
forces acting on the wing in the direction of the wing chord. 
These tension wires are also referred to as tie rods. The wire 
designed to resist the back ward forces is called a drag wire; 
the anti-drag wire resists the forward forces in the chord 
direction. Figure 1-32 illustrates the structural components 
of a basic wood wing.

At the inboard end of the wing spars is some form of wing 
attach fitting as illustrated in Figure 1-32. These provide 
a strong and secure method for attaching the wing to the 
fuselage. The interface between the wing and fuselage is often

The fairing(s) can be removed for access to the wing attach 
fittings. [Figure 1-33]

The wing tip is often a removable unit, bolted to the outboard 
end of the wing panel. One reason for this is the vulnerability 

of the wing tips to damage, especially during ground handling 
and taxiing. Figure 1-34 shows a removable wing tip for a 
large aircraft wing. Others are different. The wing tip assembly 
is of aluminum alloy construction. The wing tip cap is secured 
to the tip with countersunk screws and is secured to the 
interspar structure at four points with ¼-inch diameter bolts.
To prevent ice from forming on the leading edge of the wings 
of large aircraft, hot air from an engine is often channeled 
through the leading edge from wing root to wing tip. A louver 
on the top surface of the wing tip allows this warm air to be 
exhausted overboard. Wing position lights are located at the 
center of the tip and are not directly visible from the cockpit. 
As an indication that the wing tip light is operating, some 
wing tips are equipped with a Lucite rod to transmit the light 
to the leading edge.

Wing Skin
Often, the skin on a wing is designed to carry part of the 
flight and ground loads in combination with the spars and 
ribs. This is known as a stressed-skin design. The all-metal, 
full cantilever wing section illustrated in Figure 1-35 shows 
the structure of one such design. The lack of extra internal

Figure 1-35. The skin is an integral load carrying part of a stressed skin design.

Figure 1-36. Fuel is often carried in the wings.

or external bracing requires that the skin share some of the 
load. Notice the skin is stiffened to aid with this function.

Fuel is often carried inside the wings of a stressed-skin 
aircraft. The joints in the wing can be sealed with a special 
fuel resistant sealant enabling fuel to be stored directly inside 
the structure. This is known as wet wing design. Alternately, 
a fuel-carrying bladder or tank can be fitted inside a wing. 
Figure 1-36 shows a wing section with a box beam structural 
design such as one that might be found in a transport category 
aircraft. This structure increases strength while reducing 
weight. Proper sealing of the structure allows fuel to be stored 
in the box sections of the wing. 

The wing skin on an aircraft may be made from a wide variety 
of materials such as fabric, wood, or aluminum. But a single 
thin sheet of material is not always employed. Chemically 

milled aluminum skin can provide skin of varied thicknesses. 
On aircraft with stressed-skin wing design, honeycomb 
structured wing panels are often used as skin. A honeycomb 
structure is built up from a core material resembling a bee 
hive’s honeycomb which is laminated or sandwiched between 
thin outer skin sheets. Figure 1-37 illustrates honeycomb 
panes and their components. Panels formed like this are 
lightweight and very strong. They have a variety of uses 
on the aircraft, such as floor panels, bulkheads, and control 
surfaces, as well as wing skin panels. Figure 1-38 shows the 
locations of honeycomb construction wing panels on a jet 
transport aircraft.

A honeycomb panel can be made from a wide variety of 
materials. Aluminum core honeycomb with an outer skin of 
aluminum is common. But honeycomb in which the core is

an Arimid® fiber and the outer sheets are coated Phenolic® 
is common as well. In fact, a myriad of other material 
combinations such as those using fiberglass, plastic, Nomex®, 
Kevlar®, and carbon fiber all exist. Each honeycomb 
structure possesses unique characteristics depending upon 
the materials, dimensions, and manufacturing techniques 
employed. Figure 1-39 shows an entire wing leading edge 
formed from honeycomb structure.

Nacelles
Nacelles (sometimes called “pods”) are streamlined 
enclosures used primarily to house the engine and its 
components. They usually present a round or elliptical 
profile to the wind thus reducing aerodynamic drag. On 
most single-engine aircraft, the engine and nacelle are at the 
forward end of the fuselage. On multiengine aircraft, engine 
nacelles are built into the wings or attached to the fuselage 

at the empennage (tail section). Occasionally, a multiengine 
aircraft is designed with a nacelle in line with the fuselage aft 
of the passenger compartment. Regardless of its location, a 
nacelle contains the engine and accessories, engine mounts, 
structural members, a firewall, and skin and cowling on the 
exterior to fare the nacelle to the wind.

Some aircraft have nacelles that are designed to house the 
landing gear when retracted. Retracting the gear to reduce 
wind resistance is standard procedure on high-performance/
high-speed aircraft. The wheel well is the area where the 
landing gear is attached and stowed when retracted. Wheel 
wells can be located in the wings and/or fuselage when not 
part of the nacelle. Figure 1-40 shows an engine nacelle 
incorporating the landing gear with the wheel well extending 
into the wing root.

members similar to those of the fuselage. Lengthwise 
members, such as longerons and stringers, combine with 
horizontal/vertical members, such as rings, formers, and 
bulkheads, to give the nacelle its shape and structural 
integrity. A firewall is incorporated to isolate the engine 
compartment from the rest of the aircraft. This is basically a 
stainless steel or titanium bulkhead that contains a fire in the 
confines of the nacelle rather than letting it spread throughout 
the airframe. [Figure 1-41]

Engine mounts are also found in the nacelle. These are 
the structural assemblies to which the engine is fastened. 
They are usually constructed from chrome/molybdenum 
steel tubing in light aircraft and forged chrome/nickel/
molybdenum assemblies in larger aircraft. [Figure 1-42]

The exterior of a nacelle is covered with a skin or fitted with 
a cowling which can be opened to access the engine and 

components inside. Both are usually made of sheet aluminum 
or magnesium alloy with stainless steel or titanium alloys 
being used in high-temperature areas, such as around the 
exhaust exit. Regardless of the material used, the skin is 
typically attached to the framework with rivets.

Cowling refers to the detachable panels covering those areas 
into which access must be gained regularly, such as the engine 
and its accessories. It is designed to provide a smooth airflow 
over the nacelle and to protect the engine from damage. Cowl 
panels are generally made of aluminum alloy construction. 
However, stainless steel is often used as the inner skin aft 
of the power section and for cowl flaps and near cowl flap 
openings. It is also used for oil cooler ducts. Cowl flaps are 
moveable parts of the nacelle cowling that open and close 
to regulate engine temperature. 

There are many engine cowl designs. Figure 1-43 shows an 
exploded view of the pieces of cowling for a horizontally

opposed engine on a light aircraft. It is attached to the nacelle 
by means of screws and/or quick release fasteners. Some 
large reciprocating engines are enclosed by “orange peel” 
cowlings which provide excellent access to components 
inside the nacelle. [Figure 1-44] These cowl panels are 
attached to the forward firewall by mounts which also serve 
as hinges for opening the cowl. The lower cowl mounts are 
secured to the hinge brackets by quick release pins. The side 
and top panels are held open by rods and the lower panel is 
retained in the open position by a spring and a cable. All of 
the cowling panels are locked in the closed position by over-
center steel latches which are secured in the closed position 
by spring-loaded safety catches.

An example of a turbojet engine nacelle can be seen in 
Figure 1-45. The cowl panels are a combination of fixed 
and easily removable panels which can be opened and closed 
during maintenance. A nose cowl is also a feature on a jet 
engine nacelle. It guides air into the engine.

Empennage 
The empennage of an aircraft is also known as the tail 
section. Most empennage designs consist of a tail cone, 
fixed aerodynamic surfaces or stabilizers, and movable 
aerodynamic surfaces.

The tail cone serves to close and streamline the aft end of 
most fuselages. The cone is made up of structural members 
like those of the fuselage; however, cones are usually of 
lighter con struction since they receive less stress than the 
fuselage. [Figure 1-46]

Figure 1-48. Vertical stabilizer. 

The other components of the typical empennage are of 
heavier construction than the tail cone. These members 
include fixed surfaces that help stabilize the aircraft and 
movable surfaces that help to direct an aircraft during flight. 
The fixed surfaces are the horizon tal stabilizer and vertical 
stabilizer. The movable surfaces are usually a rudder located 
at the aft edge of the vertical stabilizer and an elevator located 
at the aft edge the horizontal stabilizer. [Figure 1-47]

The structure of the stabilizers is very similar to that which 
is used in wing construction. Figure 1-48 shows a typical 
vertical stabilizer. Notice the use of spars, ribs, stringers, 
and skin like those found in a wing. They perform the 
same functions shaping and supporting the stabilizer and 
transferring stresses. Bending, torsion, and shear created 
by air loads in flight pass from one structural member to  
another. Each member absorbs some of the stress and passes 

the remainder on to the others. Ultimately, the spar transmits 
any overloads to the fuselage. A horizontal stabilizer is built 
the same way.

The rudder and elevator are flight control surfaces that are 
also part of the empennage discussed in the next section of 
this chapter.

Flight Control Surfaces
The directional control of a fixed-wing aircraft takes place 
around the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical axes by means 
of flight control surfaces designed to create movement about 
these axes. These control devices are hinged or movable 
surfaces through which the attitude of an aircraft is controlled 
during takeoff, flight, and landing. They are usually divided 
into two major groups: 1) pri mary or main flight control 
surfaces and 2) secondary or auxiliary control surfaces.

Primary Flight Control Surfaces
The primary flight control surfaces on a fixed-wing aircraft 
include: ailerons, elevators, and the rudder. The ailerons are 
attached to the trailing edge of both wings and when moved, 
rotate the aircraft around the longitudinal axis. The elevator 
is attached to the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer. 
When it is moved, it alters aircraft pitch, which is the attitude 
about the horizontal or lateral axis. The rudder is hinged to 
the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer. When the rudder 
changes position, the aircraft rotates about the vertical axis 
(yaw). Figure 1-49 shows the primary flight controls of a 
light aircraft and the movement they create relative to the 
three axes of flight.

three axes of flight. 

Figure 1-50. Typical structure of an aluminum flight control surface. 

Figure 1-51. Composite control surfaces and some of the many 
aircraft that utilize them. 

Primary control surfaces are usually similar in construc tion 
to one another and vary only in size, shape, and methods of 
attachment. On aluminum light aircraft, their structure is 
often similar to an all-metal wing. This is appropriate because 
the primary control surfaces are simply smaller aerodynamic 
devices. They are typically made from an aluminum alloy 
structure built around a sin gle spar member or torque tube to 
which ribs are fitted and a skin is attached. The lightweight 
ribs are, in many cases, stamped out from flat aluminum sheet 
stock. Holes in the ribs lighten the assembly. An aluminum 
skin is attached with rivets. Figure 1-50 illustrates this type of 
structure, which can be found on the primary control surfaces 
of light aircraft as well as on medium and heavy aircraft.

Primary control surfaces constructed from composite 
materials are also commonly used. These are found on many 
heavy and high-performance aircraft, as well as gliders, 
home-built, and light-sport aircraft. The weight and strength 
advantages over traditional construction can be significant. 
A wide variety of materials and construction techniques are 
employed. Figure 1-51 shows examples of aircraft that use 
composite technology on primary flight control surfaces. 
Note that the control surfaces of fabric-covered aircraft 
often have fabric-covered surfaces just as aluminum-skinned 
(light) aircraft typically have all-aluminum control surfaces. 
There is a critical need for primary control surfaces to 
be balanced so they do not vibrate or flutter in the wind.

Figure 1-54. Differential aileron control movement. When one aileron 
is moved down, the aileron on the opposite wing is deflected upward. 

Figure 1-55. Transferring control surface inputs from the cockpit. 

Performed to manufacturer’s instructions, balancing usually 
consists of assuring that the center of gravity of a particular 
device is at or forward of the hinge point. Failure to properly 
balance a control surface could lead to catastrophic failure. 
Figure 1-52 illustrates several aileron configurations with 
their hinge points well aft of the leading edge. This is a 
common design feature used to prevent flutter. 

Ailerons
Ailerons are the primary flight control surfaces that move the 
aircraft about the longitudinal axis. In other words, movement 
of the ailerons in flight causes the aircraft to roll. Ailerons 
are usually located on the outboard trailing edge of each of 
the wings. They are built into the wing and are calculated as 
part of the wing’s surface area. Figure 1-53 shows aileron 
locations on various wing tip designs.

Ailerons are controlled by a side-to-side motion of the control 
stick in the cockpit or a rotation of the control yoke. When 
the aileron on one wing deflects down, the aileron on the 
opposite wing deflects upward. This amplifies the movement 
of the aircraft around the longitudinal axis. On the wing on 
which the aileron trailing edge moves downward, camber is 
increased, and lift is increased. Conversely, on the other wing, 
the raised aileron decreases lift. [Figure 1-54] The result is 

a sensitive response to the control input to roll the aircraft.
The pilot’s request for aileron movement and roll are 
transmitted from the cockpit to the actual control surface in a 
variety of ways depending on the aircraft. A system of control 
cables and pulleys, push-pull tubes, hydraulics, electric, or a 
combination of these can be employed. [Figure 1-55] 

Simple, light aircraft usually do not have hydraulic or electric 
fly-by-wire aileron control. These are found on heavy and 
high-performance aircraft. Large aircraft and some high-
performance aircraft may also have a second set of ailerons 
located inboard on the trailing edge of the wings. These 
are part of a complex system of primary and secondary 
control surfaces used to provide lateral control and stability 
in flight. At low speeds, the ailerons may be augmented by 
the use of flaps and spoilers. At high speeds, only inboard 
aileron deflection is required to roll the aircraft while the

other control surfaces are locked out or remain stationary. 
Figure 1-56 illustrates the location of the typical flight control 
surfaces found on a transport category aircraft.

Elevator
The elevator is the primary flight control surface that moves 
the aircraft around the horizontal or lateral axis. This causes the 
nose of the aircraft to pitch up or down. The elevator is hinged 
to the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer and typically 
spans most or all of its width. It is controlled in the cockpit 
by pushing or pulling the control stick or yoke forward or aft.

Light aircraft use a system of control cables and pulleys or 
push-pull tubes to transfer cockpit inputs to the movement 
of the elevator. High-performance and large aircraft 
typically employ more complex systems. Hydraulic power 
is commonly used to move the elevator on these aircraft. On 
aircraft equipped with fly-by-wire controls, a combination 
of electrical and hydraulic power is used.

Rudder 
The rudder is the primary control surface that causes an 
aircraft to yaw or move about the vertical axis. This provides 
directional control and thus points the nose of the aircraft 
in the direction desired. Most aircraft have a single rudder 
hinged to the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer. It is 
controlled by a pair of foot-operated rudder pedals in the 
cockpit.  When the right pedal is pushed forward, it deflects 

the rudder to the right which moves the nose of the aircraft 
to the right. The left pedal is rigged to simultaneously move 
aft. When the left pedal is pushed forward, the nose of the 
aircraft moves to the left.

As with the other primary flight controls, the transfer of the 
movement of the cockpit controls to the rudder varies with 
the complexity of the aircraft.  Many aircraft incorporate the 
directional movement of the nose or tail wheel into the rudder 
control system for ground operation. This allows the operator 
to steer the aircraft with the rudder pedals during taxi when 
the airspeed is not high enough for the control surfaces to be 
effective. Some large aircraft have a split rudder arrangement. 
This is actually two rudders, one above the other. At low 
speeds, both rudders deflect in the same direction when the 
pedals are pushed.  At higher speeds, one of the rudders 
becomes inoperative as the deflection of a single rudder is 
aerodynamically sufficient to maneuver the aircraft.

Dual Purpose Flight Control Surfaces
The ailerons, elevators, and rudder are considered 
conventional primary control surfaces. However, some 
aircraft are designed with a control surface that may serve a 
dual purpose. For example, elevons perform the combined 
functions of the ailerons and the elevator. [Figure 1-57]

A movable horizontal tail section, called a stabilator, is a 
control surface that combines the action of both the horizontal

stabilizer and the elevator. [Figure 1-58] Basically, a  
stabilator is a horizontal stabilizer that can also be rotated 
about the horizontal axis to affect the pitch of the aircraft.

A ruddervator combines the action of the rudder and elevator. 
[Figure 1-59] This is possible on aircraft with V–tail 
empennages where the traditional horizontal and vertical 
stabilizers do not exist. Instead, two stabilizers angle upward 
and outward from the aft fuselage in a “V” configuration. 

Each contains a movable ruddervator built into the trailing 
edge. Movement of the ruddervators can alter the movement 
of the aircraft around the horizontal and/or vertical axis. 
Additionally, some aircraft are equipped with flaperons. 
[Figure 1-60] Flaperons are ailerons which can also act as 
flaps. Flaps are secondary control surfaces on most wings, 
discussed in the next section of this chapter.

Secondary or Auxiliary Control Surfaces 
There are several secondary or auxiliary flight control 
surfaces. Their names, locations, and functions of those for 
most large aircraft are listed in Figure 1-61.

Flaps
Flaps are found on most aircraft. They are usually inboard on 
the wings’ trailing edges adjacent to the fuselage. Leading 
edge flaps are also common. They extend forward and down 
from the inboard wing leading edge. The flaps are lowered 
to increase the camber of the wings and provide greater lift 
and control at slow speeds. They enable landing at slower 
speeds and shorten the amount of runway required for takeoff 
and landing. The amount that the flaps extend and the angle 
they form with the wing can be selected from the cockpit. 
Typically, flaps can extend up to 45–50°. Figure 1-62 shows 
various aircraft with flaps in the extended position.

Flaps are usually constructed of materials and with techniques 
used on the other airfoils and control surfaces of a particular 
aircraft. Aluminum skin and structure flaps are the norm on 
light aircraft. Heavy and high-performance aircraft flaps 
may also be aluminum, but the use of composite structures 
is also common. 

There are various kinds of flaps. Plain flaps form the trailing 
edge of the wing when the flap is in the retracted position. 
[Figure 1-63A] The airflow over the wing continues over the 
upper and lower surfaces of the flap, making the trailing edge

of the flap essentially the trailing edge of the wing. The plain  
flap is hinged so that the trailing edge can be lowered. This 
increases wing camber and provides greater lift. 

A split flap is normally housed under the trailing edge of the 
wing. [Figure 1-63B] It is usually just a braced flat metal 
plate hinged at several places along its leading edge. The 
upper surface of the wing extends to the trailing edge of the 
flap. When deployed, the split flap trailing edge lowers away 
from the trailing edge of the wing. Airflow over the top of the 
wing remains the same. Airflow under the wing now follows 
the camber created by the lowered split flap, increasing lift.

Fowler flaps not only lower the trailing edge of the wing when 
deployed but also slide aft, effectively increasing the area of the 
wing. [Figure 1-63C] This creates more lift via the increased 
surface area, as well as the wing camber. When stowed, the 
fowler flap typically retracts up under the wing trailing edge 
similar to a split flap. The sliding motion of a fowler flap can 
be accomplished with a worm drive and flap tracks.

An enhanced version of the fowler flap is a set of flaps 
that actually contains more than one aerodynamic surface. 
Figure 1-64 shows a triple-slotted flap. In this configuration, 
the flap consists of a fore flap, a mid flap, and an aft flap. 
When deployed, each flap section slides aft on tracks as it 
lowers. The flap sections also separate leaving an open slot 
between the wing and the fore flap, as well as between each 
of the flap sections. Air from the underside of the wing flows 
through these slots. The result is that the laminar flow on the 
upper surfaces is enhanced. The greater camber and effective 
wing area increase overall lift.

Heavy aircraft often have leading edge flaps that are used 
in conjunction with the trailing edge flaps. [Figure 1-65] 
They can be made of machined magnesium or can have an 
aluminum or composite structure. While they are not installed 
or operate independently, their use with trailing edge flaps 
can greatly increase wing camber and lift. When stowed, 
leading edge flaps retract into the leading edge of the wing.

The differing designs of leading edge flaps essentially 
provide the same effect. Activation of the trailing edge 
flaps automatically deploys the leading edge flaps, which 
are driven out of the leading edge and downward, extending 
the camber of the wing. Figure 1-66 shows a Krueger flap, 
recognizable by its flat mid-section.

Slats 
Another leading edge device which extends wing camber is 
a slat. Slats can be operated independently of the flaps with 
their own switch in the cockpit. Slats not only extend out 
of the leading edge of the wing increasing camber and lift, 
but most often, when fully deployed leave a slot between 
their trailing edges and the leading edge of the wing. 
[Figure 1-67] This increases the angle of attack at which 
the wing will maintain its laminar airflow, resulting in the 
ability to fly the aircraft slower with a reduced stall speed, 
and still maintain control. 

Spoilers and Speed Brakes
A spoiler is a device found on the upper surface of many 
heavy and high-performance aircraft. It is stowed flush to 
the wing’s upper surface. When deployed, it raises up into 
the airstream and disrupts the laminar airflow of the wing, 
thus reducing lift. 

Spoilers are made with similar construction materials and 
techniques as the other flight control surfaces on the aircraft. 
Often, they are honeycomb-core flat panels. At low speeds, 
spoilers are rigged to operate when the ailerons operate to 
assist with the lateral movement and stability of the aircraft. 
On the wing where the aileron is moved up, the spoilers 
also raise thus amplifying the reduction of lift on that wing. 
[Figure 1-68] On the wing with downward aileron deflection,

Figure 1-67. Air passing through the slot aft of the slat promotes 
boundary layer airflow on the upper surface at high angles of attack. 

Figure 1-68. Spoilers deployed upon landing on a transport category 
aircraft. 

the spoilers remain stowed. As the speed of the aircraft  
increases, the ailerons become more effective and the spoiler 
interconnect disengages.

Spoilers are unique in that they may also be fully deployed 
on both wings to act as speed brakes. The reduced lift and 
increased drag can quickly reduce the speed of the aircraft in 
flight. Dedicated speed brake panels similar to flight spoilers 
in construction can also be found on the upper surface of 
the wings of heavy and high-performance aircraft. They are 
designed specifically to increase drag and reduce the speed 
of the aircraft when deployed. These speed brake panels 
do not operate differentially with the ailerons at low speed.  

The speed brake control in the cockpit can deploy all spoiler 
and speed brake surfaces fully when operated. Often, these 
surfaces are also rigged to deploy on the ground automatically 
when engine thrust reversers are activated. 

Tabs 
The force of the air against a control surface during the high 
speed of flight can make it difficult to move and hold that 
control surface in the deflected position. A control surface 
might also be too sensitive for similar reasons. Several different 
tabs are used to aid with these types of problems. The table 
in Figure 1-69 summarizes the various tabs and their uses.

Figure 1-70. Example of a trim tab. 

While in flight, it is desirable for the pilot to be able to take his 
or her hands and feet off of the controls and have the aircraft 
maintain its flight condition. Trims tabs are designed to allow 
this. Most trim tabs are small movable surfaces located on 
the trailing edge of a primary flight control surface. A small 
movement of the tab in the direction opposite of the direction 
the flight control surface is deflected, causing air to strike the 
tab, in turn producing a force that aids in maintaining the flight 
control surface in the desired position. Through linkage set 
from the cockpit, the tab can be positioned so that it is actually 
holding the control surface in position rather than the pilot. 
Therefore, elevator tabs are used to maintain the speed of the 
aircraft since they assist in maintaining the selected pitch. 
Rudder tabs can be set to hold yaw in check and maintain 
heading. Aileron tabs can help keep the wings level.

Occasionally, a simple light aircraft may have a stationary 
metal plate attached to the trailing edge of a primary flight 
control, usually the rudder. This is also a trim tab as shown in 
Figure 1-70. It can be bent slightly on the ground to trim the 
aircraft in flight to a hands-off condition when flying straight 
and level. The correct amount of bend can be determined only 
by flying the aircraft after an adjustment. Note that a small 
amount of bending is usually sufficient.

The aerodynamic phenomenon of moving a trim tab in one 
direction to cause the control surface to experience a force 
moving in the opposite direction is exactly what occurs with 
the use of balance tabs. [Figure 1-71] Often, it is difficult to 
move a primary control surface due to its surface area and 
the speed of the air rushing over it. Deflecting a balance tab 
hinged at the trailing edge of the control surface in the opposite 

direction of the desired control surface movement causes 
a force to position the surface in the proper direction with 
reduced force to do so. Balance tabs are usually linked directly 
to the control surface linkage so that they move automatically 
when there is an input for control surface movement. They 
also can double as trim tabs, if adjustable in the flight deck.

A servo tab is similar to a balance tab in location and effect, 
but it is designed to operate the primary flight control surface, 
not just reduce the force needed to do so. It is usually used as 
a means to back up the primary control of the flight control 
surfaces. [Figure 1-72]

Figure 1-72. Servo tabs can be used to position flight control 
surfaces in case of hydraulic failure.

Figure 1-73. Many tab linkages have a spring tab that kicks in as 
the forces needed to deflect a control increase with speed and the 
angle of desired deflection.

Figure 1-74. An aileron balance panel and linkage uses varying air pressure to assist in control surface positioning. 

On heavy aircraft, large control surfaces require too much 
force to be moved manually and are usually deflected out 
of the neutral position by hydraulic actuators. These power 
control units are signaled via a system of hydraulic valves 
connected to the yoke and rudder pedals. On fly-by-wire 
aircraft, the hydraulic actuators that move the flight control 

surfaces are signaled by electric input. In the case of hydraulic 
system failure(s), manual linkage to a servo tab can be used 
to deflect it. This, in turn, provides an aerodynamic force 
that moves the primary control surface. 

A control surface may require excessive force to move only 
in the final stages of travel. When this is the case, a spring 
tab can be used. This is essentially a servo tab that does not 
activate until an effort is made to move the control surface 
beyond a certain point. When reached, a spring in line of the 
control linkage aids in moving the control surface through 
the remainder of its travel. [Figure 1-73]

Figure 1-74 shows another way of assisting the movement of 
an aileron on a large aircraft. It is called an aileron balance 
panel. Not visible when approaching the aircraft, it is 
positioned in the linkage that hinges the aileron to the wing. 

Balance panels have been constructed typically of aluminum 
skin-covered frame assemblies or aluminum honeycomb 
structures. The trailing edge of the wing just forward of the 
leading edge of the aileron is sealed to allow controlled airflow 
in and out of the hinge area where the balance panel is located.

Figure 1-75. The trailing edge of the wing just forward of the leading 
edge of the aileron is sealed to allow controlled airflow in and out

Figure 1-76. An antiservo tab moves in the same direction as the 
control tab. Shown here on a stabilator, it desensitizes the pitch 
control. 

Figure 1-77. A winglet reduces aerodynamic drag caused by air 
spilling off of the wing tip. 

[Figure 1-75] When the aileron is moved from the neutral 
position, differential pressure builds up on one side of the 
balance panel. This differential pressure acts on the balance 
panel in a direction that assists the aileron movement. For 
slight movements, deflecting the control tab at the trailing 
edge of the aileron is easy enough to not require significant 
assistance from the balance tab. (Moving the control tab moves 
the ailerons as desired.) But, as greater deflection is requested, 
the force resisting control tab and aileron movement becomes 
greater and augmentation from the balance tab is needed. The 
seals and mounting geometry allow the differential pressure 
of airflow on the balance panel to increase as deflection of 
the ailerons is increased. This makes the resistance felt when 
moving the aileron controls relatively constant.

Antiservo tabs, as the name suggests, are like servo tabs but 
move in the same direction as the primary control surface. 
On some aircraft, especially those with a movable horizontal 
stabilizer, the input to the control surface can be too sensitive. 
An antiservo tab tied through the control linkage creates an 
aerodynamic force that increases the effort needed to move 
the control surface. This makes flying the aircraft more 
stable for the pilot. Figure 1-76 shows an antiservo tab in 
the near neutral position. Deflected in the same direction as 
the desired stabilator movement, it increases the required 
control surface input.

Other Wing Features
There may be other structures visible on the wings of an 
aircraft that contribute to performance. Winglets, vortex 
generators, stall fences, and gap seals are all common wing 
features. Introductory descriptions of each are given in the 
following paragraphs. 

A winglet is an obvious vertical upturn of the wing’s tip 
resembling a vertical stabilizer. It is an aerodynamic device 
designed to reduce the drag created by wing tip vortices in 
flight. Usually made from aluminum or composite materials, 
winglets can be designed to optimize performance at a desired 
speed. [Figure 1-77]

Vortex generators are small airfoil sections usually attached 
to the upper surface of a wing. [Figure 1-78] They are 
designed to promote positive laminar airflow over the 
wing and control surfaces. Usually made of aluminum and 
installed in a spanwise line or lines, the vortices created by 
these devices swirl downward assisting maintenance of the 
boundary layer of air flowing over the wing. They can also 
be found on the fuselage and empennage. Figure 1-79 shows 
the unique vortex generators on a Symphony SA-160 wing.

A chordwise barrier on the upper surface of the wing, called 
a stall fence, is used to halt the spanwise flow of air. During 
low speed flight, this can maintain proper chordwise airflow 
reducing the tendency for the wing to stall. Usually made 
of aluminum, the fence is a fixed structure most common 
on swept wings, which have a natural spanwise tending 
boundary air flow. [Figure 1-80]

Figure 1-80. A stall fence aids in maintaining chordwise airflow 
over the wing. 

Figure 1-81. Gap seals promote the smooth flow of air over gaps between fixed and movable surfaces. 

Often, a gap can exist between the stationary trailing edge 
of a wing or stabilizer and the movable control surface(s). 
At high angles of attack, high pressure air from the lower 
wing surface can be disrupted at this gap. The result can 
be turbulent airflow, which increases drag. There is also a 
tendency for some lower wing boundary air to enter the gap 

and disrupt the upper wing surface airflow, which in turn 
reduces lift and control surface responsiveness. The use of 
gap seals is common to promote smooth airflow in these gap 
areas. Gap seals can be made of a wide variety of materials 
ranging from aluminum and impregnated fabric to foam 
and plastic. Figure 1-81 shows some gap seals installed on 
various aircraft.

Landing Gear
The landing gear supports the aircraft during landing and 
while it is on the ground. Simple aircraft that fly at low speeds 
generally have fixed gear. This means the gear is stationary 
and does not retract for flight. Faster, more complex aircraft 
have retractable landing gear. After takeoff, the landing 
gear is retracted into the fuselage or wings and out of the 
airstream. This is important because extended gear create 
significant parasite drag which reduces performance. Parasite 
drag is caused by the friction of the air flowing over the

Figure 1-82. Landing gear can be fixed (top) or retractable (bottom). 

gear. It increases with speed. On very light, slow aircraft, the  
extra weight that accompanies a retractable landing gear is 
more of a detriment than the drag caused by the fixed gear. 
Lightweight fairings and wheel pants can be used to keep 
drag to a minimum. Figure 1-82 shows examples of fixed 
and retractable gear. 

Landing gear must be strong enough to withstand the forces 
of landing when the aircraft is fully loaded. In addition to 
strength, a major design goal is to have the gear assembly be 
as light as possible. To accomplish this, landing gear are made 
from a wide range of materials including steel, aluminum, 
and magnesium. Wheels and tires are designed specifically 
for aviation use and have unique operating characteristics. 
Main wheel assemblies usually have a braking system. To 
aid with the potentially high impact of landing, most landing 
gear have a means of either absorbing shock or accepting 
shock and distributing it so that the structure is not damaged. 

Not all aircraft landing gear are configured with wheels. 
Helicopters, for example, have such high maneuverability 
and low landing speeds that a set of fixed skids is common 
and quite functional with lower maintenance. The same is true 
for free balloons which fly slowly and land on wood skids 
affixed to the floor of the gondola. Other aircraft landing gear 
are equipped with pontoons or floats for operation on water. 
A large amount of drag accompanies this type of gear, but an 
aircraft that can land and take off on water can be very useful 
in certain environments. Even skis can be found under some 
aircraft for operation on snow and ice. Figure 1-83 shows 
some of these alternative landing gear, the majority of which 
are the fixed gear type.

Amphibious aircraft are aircraft than can land either on land 
or on water. On some aircraft designed for such dual usage, 
the bottom half of the fuselage acts as a hull. Usually, it is 
accompanied by outriggers on the underside of the wings 
near the tips to aid in water landing and taxi. Main gear that

boat because the fuselage doubles as a hull.

retract into the fuselage are only extended when landing on 
the ground or a runway. This type of amphibious aircraft is 
sometimes called a flying boat. [Figure 1-84]

Many aircraft originally designed for land use can be fitted 
with floats with retractable wheels for amphibious use. 
[Figure 1-85] Typically, the gear retracts into the float 
when not needed. Sometimes a dorsal fin is added to the aft 
underside of the fuselage for longitudinal stability during 
water operations. It is even possible on some aircraft to direct 
this type of fin by tying its control into the aircraft’s rudder 
pedals. Skis can also be fitted with wheels that retract to allow 
landing on solid ground or on snow and ice.

Tail Wheel Gear Configuration
There are two basic configurations of airplane landing gear: 
conventional gear or tail wheel gear and the tricycle gear. 
Tail wheel gear dominated early aviation and therefore 
has become known as conventional gear. In addition to its 
two main wheels which are positioned under most of the 
weight of the aircraft, the conventional gear aircraft also 
has a smaller wheel located at the aft end of the fuselage. 

[Figure 1-86] Often this tail wheel is able to be steered 
by rigging cables attached to the rudder pedals. Other 
conventional gear have no tail wheel at all using just a steel 
skid plate under the aft fuselage instead. The small tail wheel 
or skid plate allows the fuselage to incline, thus giving 
clearance for the long propellers that prevailed in aviation 
through WWII. It also gives greater clearance between the 
propeller and loose debris when operating on an unpaved 
runway. But the inclined fuselage blocks the straight-ahead 
vision of the pilot during ground operations. Until up to speed 
where the elevator becomes effective to lift the tail wheel off 
the ground, the pilot must lean his head out the side of the 
cockpit to see directly ahead of the aircraft. 

The use of tail wheel gear can pose another difficulty. When 
landing, tail wheel aircraft can easily ground loop. A ground 
loop is when the tail of the aircraft swings around and comes 
forward of the nose of the aircraft. The reason this happens 
is due to the two main wheels being forward of the aircraft’s 
center of gravity. The tail wheel is aft of the center of gravity. 
If the aircraft swerves upon landing, the tail wheel can swing 
out to the side of the intended path of travel. If far enough 
to the side, the tail can pull the center of gravity out from its 
desired location slightly aft of but between the main gear. 
Once the center of gravity is no longer trailing the mains, 
the tail of the aircraft freely pivots around the main wheels 
causing the ground loop. 

Conventional gear is useful and is still found on certain models 
of aircraft manufactured today, particularly aerobatic aircraft, 
crop dusters, and aircraft designed for unpaved runway use. 
It is typically lighter than tricycle gear which requires a stout, 
fully shock absorbing nose wheel assembly. The tail wheel 
configuration excels when operating out of unpaved runways. 
With the two strong main gear forward providing stability 
and directional control during takeoff roll, the lightweight tail 
wheel does little more than keep the aft end of the fuselage 
from striking the ground. As mentioned, at a certain speed, 


1-38

Figure 1-87. Tricycle landing gear is the most predominant landing gear configuration in aviation. 

the air flowing over the elevator is sufficient for it to raise the 
tail off the ground. As speed increases further, the two main 
wheels under the center of gravity are very stable. 

Tricycle Gear Configuration
Tricycle gear is the most prevalent landing gear configuration 
in aviation. In addition to the main wheels, a shock absorbing 
nose wheel is at the forward end of the fuselage. Thus, the 
center of gravity is then forward of the main wheels. The tail 
of the aircraft is suspended off the ground and clear view 
straight ahead from the cockpit is given. Ground looping 
is nearly eliminated since the center of gravity follows the 
directional nose wheel and remains between the mains.

Light aircraft use tricycle gear, as well as heavy aircraft. Twin 
nose wheels on the single forward strut and massive multistrut/
multiwheel main gear may be found supporting the world’s 
largest aircraft, but the basic configuration is still tricycle. 
The nose wheel may be steered with the rudder pedals on 
small aircraft. Larger aircraft often have a nose wheel steering 
wheel located off to the side of the cockpit. Figure 1-87 shows 
aircraft with tricycle gear. Chapter 13, Aircraft Landing Gear 
Systems, discusses landing gear in detail.

Maintaining the Aircraft
Maintenance of an aircraft is of the utmost importance 
for safe flight. Certificated technicians are committed to 
perform timely maintenance functions in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions and under Title 14 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (14 CFR). At no time is an act of aircraft 
maintenance taken lightly or improvised. The consequences 
of such action could be fatal, and the technician could lose 
his or her certificate and face criminal charges.

Airframe, engine, and aircraft component manufacturers are 
responsible for documenting the maintenance procedures that 
guide managers and technicians on when and how to perform 
maintenance on their products. A small aircraft may only 

require a few manuals, including the aircraft maintenance 
manual. This volume usually contains the most frequently 
used information required to maintain the aircraft properly. 
The Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) for an aircraft also 
contains critical information. Complex and large aircraft 
require several manuals to convey correct maintenance 
procedures adequately. In addition to the maintenance 
manual, manufacturers may produce such volumes as 
structural repair manuals, overhaul manuals, wiring diagram 
manuals, component manuals, and more. 

Note that the use of the word “manual” is meant to include 
electronic as well as printed information. Also, proper 
maintenance extends to the use of designated tools and 
fixtures called out in the manufacturer’s maintenance 
documents. In the past, not using the proper tooling has 
caused damage to critical components, which subsequently 
failed and led to aircraft crashes and the loss of human 
life. The technician is responsible for sourcing the correct 
information, procedures, and tools needed to perform 
airworthy maintenance or repairs.

Standard aircraft maintenance procedures do exist and can 
be used by the technician when performing maintenance or a 
repair. These are found in the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) approved advisory circulars (AC) 43.13-2 and AC 
43.13-1. If not addressed by the manufacturer’s literature, 
the technician may use the procedures outlined in these 
manuals to complete the work in an acceptable manner. These 
procedures are not specific to any aircraft or component 
and typically cover methods used during maintenance of all 
aircraft. Note that the manufacturer’s instructions supersede 
the general procedures found in AC 43.13-2 and AC 43.13-1.

All maintenance related actions on an aircraft or component 
are required to be documented by the performing technician 
in the aircraft or component logbook. Light aircraft may have 
only one logbook for all work performed. Some aircraft may

have a separate engine logbook for any work performed on 
the engine(s). Other aircraft have separate propeller logbooks.
Large aircraft require volumes of maintenance documentation 
comprised of thousands of procedures performed by hundreds 
of technicians. Electronic dispatch and recordkeeping of 
maintenance performed on large aircraft such as airliners 
is common. The importance of correct maintenance 
recordkeeping should not be overlooked.

Location Numbering Systems
Even on small, light aircraft, a method of precisely locating 
each structural component is required. Various numbering 
systems are used to facilitate the location of specific wing 
frames, fuselage bulkheads, or any other structural members 
on an aircraft. Most manufacturers use some system of 
station marking. For example, the nose of the air craft may be 
designated “zero station,” and all other stations are located at 
measured distances in inches behind the zero station. Thus, 
when a blueprint reads “fuselage frame station 137,” that 
particular frame station can be located 137 inches behind 
the nose of the aircraft.

To locate structures to the right or left of the center line of an 
aircraft, a similar method is employed. Many manufacturers 
con sider the center line of the aircraft to be a zero station 
from which measurements can be taken to the right or left 
to locate an airframe member. This is often used on the 
horizontal stabilizer and wings. 
 
The applicable manufacturer’s numbering system and 
abbreviated designations or symbols should al ways be 
reviewed before attempting to locate a structural member. 
They are not always the same. The following list includes 
loca tion designations typical of those used by many 
manufacturers.

• Fuselage stations (Fus. Sta. or FS) are numbered in 
inches from a reference or zero point known as the 

reference datum. [Figure 1-88] The reference datum 
is an imaginary ver tical plane at or near the nose of 
the aircraft from which all fore and aft dis tances are 
measured. The distance to a given point is measured 
in inches paral lel to a center line extending through 
the aircraft from the nose through the center of the 
tail cone. Some manufacturers may call the fuselage 
station a body sta tion, abbreviated BS. 

• Buttock line or butt line (BL) is a vertical reference 
plane down the center of the aircraft from which 
measurements left or right can be made. [Figure 1-89]

• Water line (WL) is the measurement of height in 
inches perpendicular from a horizontal plane usually 
located at the ground, cabin floor, or some other easily 
referenced location. [Figure 1-90]

 • Aileron station (AS) is measured out board from, 
and parallel to, the inboard edge of the aileron, 
perpendicular to the rear beam of the wing. 

• Flap station (KS) is measured perpendicular to the rear 
beam of the wing and parallel to, and outboard from, 
the in board edge of the flap. 

• Nacelle station (NC or Nac. Sta.) is measured either 
forward of or behind the front spar of the wing and 
perpendic ular to a designated water line. 

In addition to the location stations listed above, other 
measurements are used, especially on large aircraft. Thus, 
there may be horizontal stabilizer stations (HSS), vertical 
stabilizer stations (VSS) or powerplant stations (PPS). 
[Figure 1-91] In every case, the manufacturer’s terminology 
and station lo cation system should be consulted before 
locating a point on a particular aircraft.

Another method is used to facilitate the location of aircraft 
components on air transport aircraft. This involves dividing 
the aircraft into zones. These large areas or major zones

are further divided into sequentially numbered zones and 
subzones. The digits of the zone number are reserved and  
indexed to indicate the location and type of system of which 
the component is a part. Figure 1-92 illustrates these zones 
and subzones on a transport category aircraft. 

Access and Inspection Panels
Knowing where a particular structure or component is located 
on an aircraft needs to be combined with gaining access to 
that area to perform the required inspections or maintenance. 
To facilitate this, access and inspection panels are located on 
most surfaces of the aircraft. Small panels that are hinged or 
removable allow inspection and servicing. Large panels and 
doors allow components to be removed and installed, as well 
as human entry for maintenance purposes. 

The underside of a wing, for example, sometimes contains 
dozens of small panels through which control cable 
components can be monitored and fittings greased. Various 
drains and jack points may also be on the underside of 

the wing. The upper surface of the wings typically have 
fewer access panels because a smooth surface promotes 
better laminar airflow, which causes lift. On large aircraft, 
walkways are sometimes designated on the wing upper 
surface to permit safe navigation by mechanics and inspectors 
to critical structures and components located along the 
wing’s leading and trailing edges. Wheel wells and special 
component bays are places where numerous components and 
accessories are grouped together for easy maintenance access. 

Panels and doors on aircraft are numbered for positive 
identification. On large aircraft, panels are usually numbered 
sequentially containing zone and subzone information in the 
panel number. Designation for a left or right side location on 
the aircraft is often indicated in the panel number. This could 
be with an “L” or “R,” or panels on one side of the aircraft 
could be odd numbered and the other side even numbered. 
The manufacturer’s maintenance manual explains the panel 
numbering system and often has numerous diagrams and 
tables showing the location of various components and under 
which panel they may be found. Each manufacturer is entitled 
to develop its own panel numbering system.

Helicopter Structures
The structures of the helicopter are designed to give the 
helicopter its unique flight characteristics. A simplified 
explanation of how a helicopter flies is that the rotors are 
rotating airfoils that provide lift similar to the way wings 
provide lift on a fixed-wing aircraft. Air flows faster over the 
curved upper surface of the rotors, causing a negative pressure 
and thus, lifting the aircraft. Changing the angle of attack of 
the rotating blades increases or decreases lift, respectively 
raising or lowering the helicopter. Tilting the rotor plane of 
rotation causes the aircraft to move horizontally. Figure 1-93 
shows the major components of a typical helicopter.

Airframe
The airframe, or fundamental structure, of a helicopter can be 
made of either metal or wood composite materials, or some

combination of the two. Typically, a composite component 
consists of many layers of fiber-impregnated resins, bonded 
to form a smooth panel. Tubular and sheet metal substructures 
are usually made of aluminum, though stainless steel or 
titanium are sometimes used in areas subject to higher 
stress or heat. Airframe design encompasses engineering, 
aerodynamics, materials technology, and manufacturing 
methods to achieve favorable balances of performance, 
reliability, and cost.

Fuselage
As with fixed-wing aircraft, helicopter fuselages and tail 
booms are often truss-type or semimonocoque structures 
of stress-skin design. Steel and aluminum tubing, formed 
aluminum, and aluminum skin are commonly used. Modern 
helicopter fuselage design includes an increasing utilization 
of advanced composites as well. Firewalls and engine 
decks are usually stainless steel. Helicopter fuselages vary 
widely from those with a truss frame, two seats, no doors, 
and a monocoque shell flight compartment to those with 
fully enclosed airplane-style cabins as found on larger 
twin-engine helicopters. The multidirectional nature of 
helicopter flight makes wide-range visibility from the 
cockpit essential. Large, formed polycarbonate, glass, or 
plexiglass windscreens are common.

Landing Gear or Skids
As mentioned, a helicopter’s landing gear can be simply a 
set of tubular metal skids. Many helicopters do have landing 
gear with wheels, some retractable.  

Powerplant and Transmission
The two most common types of engine used in helicopters are 
the reciprocating engine and the turbine engine. Reciprocating 
engines, also called piston engines, are generally used 
in smaller helicopters. Most training helicopters use 
reciprocating engines because they are relatively simple 
and inexpensive to operate. Refer to the Pilot’s Handbook 
of Aeronautical Knowledge for a detailed explanation and 
illustrations of the piston engine.

Turbine Engines
Turbine engines are more powerful and are used in a wide 
variety of helicopters. They produce a tremendous amount 
of power for their size but are generally more expensive 
to operate. The turbine engine used in helicopters operates 
differently than those used in airplane applications. In most 
applications, the exhaust outlets simply release expended 
gases and do not contribute to the forward motion of the 
helicopter. Because the airflow is not a straight line pass 
through as in jet engines and is not used for propulsion, the

Figure 1-94. Many helicopters use a turboshaft engine to drive the main transmission and rotor systems. The main difference between 
a turboshaft and a turbojet engine is that most of the energy produced by the expanding gases is used to drive a turbine rather than 
producing thrust through the expulsion of exhaust gases.

cooling effect of the air is limited. Approximately 75 percent 
of the incoming airflow is used to cool the engine.

The gas turbine engine mounted on most helicopters is 
made up of a compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, 
and accessory gearbox assembly. The compressor draws 
filtered air into the plenum chamber and compresses it. 
Common type filters are centrifugal swirl tubes where debris 
is ejected outward and blown overboard prior to entering 
the compressor, or engine barrier filters (EBF), a paper 
element type filter, encased in a frame with a screen/grill 
over the inlet, and usually coated with an oil. This design 
significantly reduces the ingestion of foreign object debris 
(FOD). The compressed air is directed to the combustion 
section through discharge tubes where atomized fuel is 
injected into it. The fuel/air mixture is ignited and allowed 
to expand. This combustion gas is then forced through a 
series of turbine wheels causing them to turn. These turbine 
wheels provide power to both the engine compressor and the 
accessory gearbox. Depending on model and manufacturer, 
the rpm range can vary from a range low of 20,000 to a range 
high of 51,600.

Power is provided to the main rotor and tail rotor systems 
through the freewheeling unit which is attached to the 
accessory gearbox power output gear shaft. The combustion 
gas is finally expelled through an exhaust outlet. The 
temperature of gas is measured at different locations and is 
referenced differently by each manufacturer. Some common 
terms are: inter-turbine temperature (ITT), exhaust gas 
temperature (EGT), or turbine outlet temperature (TOT). 

TOT is used throughout this discussion for simplicity 
purposes. [Figure 1-94]

Transmission
The transmission system transfers power from the engine to 
the main rotor, tail rotor, and other accessories during normal 
flight conditions. The main components of the transmission 
system are the main rotor transmission, tail rotor drive 
system, clutch, and freewheeling unit. The freewheeling unit, 
or autorotative clutch, allows the main rotor transmission to 
drive the tail rotor drive shaft during autorotation. Helicopter 
transmissions are normally lubricated and cooled with their 
own oil supply. A sight gauge is provided to check the oil 
level. Some transmissions have chip detectors located in the 
sump. These detectors are wired to warning lights located 
on the pilot’s instrument panel that illuminate in the event 
of an internal problem. Some chip detectors on modern 
helicopters have a “burn off” capability and attempt to correct 
the situation without pilot action. If the problem cannot be 
corrected on its own, the pilot must refer to the emergency 
procedures for that particular helicopter. 

Main Rotor System
The rotor system is the rotating part of a helicopter which 
generates lift. The rotor consists of a mast, hub, and rotor 
blades. The mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends 
upwards from and is driven, and sometimes supported, by 
the transmission. At the top of the mast is the attachment 
point for the rotor blades called the hub. The rotor blades are 
then attached to the hub by any number of different methods. 
Main rotor systems are classified according to how the main

rotor blades are attached and move relative to the main rotor 
hub. There are three basic classifications: rigid, semirigid, 
or fully articulated. 

Rigid Rotor System
The simplest is the rigid rotor system. In this system, the 
rotor blades are rigidly attached to the main rotor hub and 
are not free to slide back and forth (drag) or move up and 
down (flap). [Figure 1-95] The forces tending to make the 
rotor blades do so are absorbed by the flexible properties of 
the blade. The pitch of the blades, however, can be adjusted 
by rotation about the spanwise axis via the feathering hinges. 
 
Semirigid Rotor System
The semirigid rotor system in Figure 1-96 makes use of a 
teetering hinge at the blade attach point. While held in check 
from sliding back and forth, the teetering hinge does allow 
the blades to flap up and down. With this hinge, when one 
blade flaps up, the other flaps down.

Flapping is caused by a phenomenon known as dissymmetry 
of lift. As the plane of rotation of the rotor blades is tilted and 
the helicopter begins to move forward, an advancing blade 
and a retreating blade become established (on two-bladed 
systems). The relative windspeed is greater on an advancing 
blade than it is on a retreating blade. This causes greater lift 
to be developed on the advancing blade, causing it to rise 

up or flap. When blade rotation reaches the point where the 
blade becomes the retreating blade, the extra lift is lost and 
the blade flaps downward. [Figure 1-97]

Fully Articulated Rotor System
Fully articulated rotor blade systems provide hinges that 
allow the rotors to move fore and aft, as well as up and

300 knots. If the helicopter is moving forward at 100 knots, the 
relative windspeed on the advancing side is 400 knots. On the 
retreating side, it is only 200 knots. This difference in speed causes 
a dissymetry of lift.

down. This lead-lag, drag, or hunting movement as it is 
called is in response to the Coriolis effect during rotational 
speed changes. When first starting to spin, the blades lag 
until centrifugal force is fully developed. Once rotating, a 
reduction in speed causes the blades to lead the main rotor 
hub until forces come into balance. Constant fluctuations in 
rotor blade speeds cause the blades to “hunt.” They are free 
to do so in a fully articulating system due to being mounted 
on the vertical drag hinge. 

One or more horizontal hinges provide for flapping on a 
fully articulated rotor system. Also, the feathering hinge 
allows blade pitch changes by permitting rotation about the 
spanwise axis. Various dampers and stops can be found on 
different designs to reduce shock and limit travel in certain 
directions. Figure 1-98 shows a fully articulated main rotor 
system with the features discussed. 

Numerous designs and variations on the three types of main 
rotor systems exist. Engineers continually search for ways to 
reduce vibration and noise caused by the rotating parts of the 
helicopter. Toward that end, the use of elastomeric bearings 
in main rotor systems is increasing. These polymer bearings 
have the ability to deform and return to their original shape. 
As such, they can absorb vibration that would normally be 
transferred by steel bearings. They also do not require regular 
lubrication, which reduces maintenance.

Some modern helicopter main rotors have been designed 
with flextures. These are hubs and hub components that are 
made out of advanced composite materials. They are designed 
to take up the forces of blade hunting and dissymmetry of 

lift by flexing. As such, many hinges and bearings can be 
eliminated from the traditional main rotor system. The result 
is a simpler rotor mast with lower maintenance due to fewer 
moving parts. Often designs using flextures incorporate 
elastomeric bearings. [Figure 1-99]

Antitorque System
Ordinarily, helicopters have between two and seven main 
rotor blades. These rotors are usually made of a composite 
structure. The large rotating mass of the main rotor blades 
of a helicopter produce torque. This torque increases with 
engine power and tries to spin the fuselage in the opposite 
direction. The tail boom and tail rotor, or antitorque rotor, 
counteract this torque effect. [Figure 1-100] Controlled 
with foot pedals, the countertorque of the tail rotor must be

modulated as engine power levels are changed. This is done 
by changing the pitch of the tail rotor blades. This, in turn, 
changes the amount of countertorque, and the aircraft can be 
rotated about its vertical axis, allowing the pilot to control 
the direction the helicopter is facing.

Similar to a vertical stabilizer on the empennage of an 
airplane, a fin or pylon is also a common feature on rotorcraft. 
Normally, it supports the tail rotor assembly, although 
some tail rotors are mounted on the tail cone of the boom. 
Additionally, a horizontal member called a stabilizer is often 
constructed at the tail cone or on the pylon. 

A Fenestron® is a unique tail rotor design which is actually a 
multiblade ducted fan mounted in the vertical pylon. It works 
the same way as an ordinary tail rotor, providing sideways 
thrust to counter the torque produced by the main rotors. 
[Figure 1-101] 

A NOTAR® antitorque system has no visible rotor mounted 
on the tail boom. Instead, an engine-driven adjustable fan 
is located inside the tail boom. NOTAR® is an acronym 
that stands for “no tail rotor.” As the speed of the main 
rotor changes, the speed of the NOTAR® fan changes. Air 
is vented out of two long slots on the right side of the tail 
boom, entraining main rotor wash to hug the right side of the 
tail boom, in turn causing laminar flow and a low pressure 
(Coanda Effect). This low pressure causes a force counter 
to the torque produced by the main rotor. Additionally, the 
remainder of the air from the fan is sent through the tail 
boom to a vent on the aft left side of the boom where it is 
expelled. This action to the left causes an opposite reaction 

to the right, which is the direction needed to counter the main 
rotor torque. [Figures 1-102]

Controls
The controls of a helicopter differ slightly from those found 
in an aircraft. The collective, operated by the pilot with the 
left hand, is pulled up or pushed down to increase or decrease 
the angle of attack on all of the rotor blades simultaneously. 
This increases or decreases lift and moves the aircraft up 
or down. The engine throttle control is located on the hand 
grip at the end of the collective. The cyclic is the control 
“stick” located between the pilot’s legs. It can be moved in

Aerodynamics, Aircraft 
Assembly, and Rigging
Introduction
Three topics that are directly related to the manufacture, 
operation, and repair of aircraft are: aerodynamics, aircraft 
assembly, and rigging. Each of these subject areas, though 
studied separately, eventually connect to provide a scientific 
and physical understanding of how an aircraft is prepared for 
flight. A logical place to start with these three topics is the study 
of basic aerodynamics. By studying aerodynamics, a person 
becomes familiar with the fundamentals of aircraft flight.

Basic Aerodynamics 
Aerodynamics is the study of the dynamics of gases, the 
interaction between a moving object and the atmosphere 
being of primary interest for this handbook. The movement of 
an object and its reaction to the air flow around it can be seen 
when watching water passing the bow of a ship. The major 
difference between water and air is that air is compressible 
and water is incompressible. The action of the airflow over 
a body is a large part of the study of aerodynamics. Some 
common aircraft terms, such as rudder, hull, water line, and 
keel beam, were borrowed from nautical terms. 

Many textbooks have been written about the aerodynamics 
of aircraft flight. It is not necessary for an airframe and 
powerplant (A&P) mechanic to be as knowledgeable as an 
aeronautical engineer about aerodynamics. The mechanic 
must be able to understand the relationships between 
how an aircraft performs in flight and its reaction to the 
forces acting on its structural parts. Understanding why 
aircraft are designed with particular types of primary and 
secondary control systems and why the surfaces must be 
aerodynamically smooth becomes essential when maintaining 
today’s complex aircraft. 

The theory of flight should be described in terms of the laws 
of flight because what happens to an aircraft when it flies 
is not based upon assumptions, but upon a series of facts. 
Aerodynamics is a study of laws which have been proven 
to be the physical reasons why an airplane flies. The term 
aerodynamics is derived from the combination of two Greek 
words: “aero,” meaning air, and “dyne,” meaning force of 
power. Thus, when “aero” joins “dynamics” the result is 
“aerodynamics”—the study of objects in motion through 
the air and the forces that produce or change such motion. 

Aerodynamically, an aircraft can be defined as an object 
traveling through space that is affected by the changes 
in atmospheric conditions. To state it another way, 
aerodynamics covers the relationships between the aircraft, 
relative wind, and atmosphere. 

The Atmosphere
Before examining the fundamental laws of flight, several 
basic facts must be considered, namely that an aircraft 
operates in the air. Therefore, those properties of air that 
affect the control and performance of an aircraft must be 
understood. 

The air in the earth’s atmosphere is composed mostly of 
nitrogen and oxygen. Air is considered a fluid because it 
fits the definition of a substance that has the ability to flow 
or assume the shape of the container in which it is enclosed. 
If the container is heated, pressure increases; if cooled, the 

pressure decreases. The weight of air is heaviest at sea level 
where it has been compressed by all of the air above. This 
compression of air is called atmospheric pressure. 

Pressure
Atmospheric pressure is usually defined as the force exerted 
against the earth’s surface by the weight of the air above 
that surface. Weight is force applied to an area that results 
in pressure. Force (F) equals area (A) times pressure (P), or 
F = AP. Therefore, to find the amount of pressure, divide 
area into force (P = F/A). A column of air (one square inch) 
extending from sea level to the top of the atmosphere weighs 
approximately 14.7 pounds; therefore, atmospheric pressure 
is stated in pounds per square inch (psi). Thus, atmospheric 
pressure at sea level is 14.7 psi.

Atmospheric pressure is measured with an instrument 
called a barometer, composed of mercury in a tube that 
records atmospheric pressure in inches of mercury (""Hg). 
[Figure 2-1] The standard measurement in aviation altimeters 
and U.S. weather reports has been ""Hg. However, worldwide 
weather maps and some non-U.S. manufactured aircraft 
instruments indicate pressure in millibars (mb), a metric unit. 
At sea level, when the average atmospheric pressure is 
14.7 psi, the barometric pressure is 29.92 ""Hg, and the metric 
measurement is 1013.25 mb. 

An important consideration is that atmospheric pressure 
varies with altitude. As an aircraft ascends, atmospheric 
pressure drops, oxygen content of the air decreases, and 
temperature drops. The changes in altitude affect an aircraft’s 
performance in such areas as lift and engine horsepower. The 


2-3

effects of temperature, altitude, and density of air on aircraft 
performance are covered in the following paragraphs. 

Density
Density is weight per unit of volume. Since air is a mixture 
of gases, it can be compressed. If the air in one container is 
under half as much pressure as an equal amount of air in an 
identical container, the air under the greater pressure weighs 
twice as much as that in the container under lower pressure. 
The air under greater pressure is twice as dense as that in 
the other container. For the equal weight of air, that which 
is under the greater pressure occupies only half the volume 
of that under half the pressure.

The density of gases is governed by the following rules:

1. Density varies in direct proportion with the pressure.

2. Density varies inversely with the temperature.

Thus, air at high altitudes is less dense than air at low 
altitudes, and a mass of hot air is less dense than a mass of 
cool air. 

Changes in density affect the aerodynamic performance of 
aircraft with the same horsepower. An aircraft can fly faster at 
a high altitude where the density is low than at a low altitude 
where the density is greater. This is because air offers less 
resistance to the aircraft when it contains a smaller number 
of air particles per unit of volume. 

Humidity
Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. The 
maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold varies 
with the temperature. The higher the temperature of the air, 
the more water vapor it can absorb. 

1. Absolute humidity is the weight of water vapor in a 
unit volume of air.

2. Relative humidity is the ratio, in percent, of the 
moisture actually in the air to the moisture it would 
hold if it were saturated at the same temperature and 
pressure. 

Assuming that the temperature and pressure remain the same, 
the density of the air varies inversely with the humidity. On 
damp days, the air density is less than on dry days. For this 
reason, an aircraft requires a longer runway for takeoff on 
damp days than it does on dry days. 

By itself, water vapor weighs approximately five-eighths 
as much as an equal amount of perfectly dry air. Therefore, 
when air contains water vapor, it is not as heavy as dry air 
containing no moisture.

Aerodynamics and the Laws of Physics
The law of conservation of energy states that energy may 
neither be created nor destroyed.

Motion is the act or process of changing place or position. 
An object may be in motion with respect to one object and 
motionless with respect to another. For example, a person 
sitting quietly in an aircraft flying at 200 knots is at rest or 
motionless with respect to the aircraft; however, the person 
and the aircraft are in motion with respect to the air and to 
the earth.

Air has no force or power, except pressure, unless it is in 
motion. When it is moving, however, its force becomes 
apparent. A moving object in motionless air has a force 
exerted on it as a result of its own motion. It makes no 
difference in the effect then, whether an object is moving 
with respect to the air or the air is moving with respect to 
the object. The flow of air around an object caused by the 
movement of either the air or the object, or both, is called 
the relative wind. 

Velocity and Acceleration
The terms “speed” and “velocity” are often used 
interchangeably, but they do not have the same meaning. 
Speed is the rate of motion in relation to time, and velocity is 
the rate of motion in a particular direction in relation to time. 

An aircraft starts from New York City and flies 10 hours at 
an average speed of 260 miles per hour (mph). At the end of 
this time, the aircraft may be over the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific 
Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, or, if its flight were in a circular path, 
it may even be back over New York City. If this same aircraft 
flew at a velocity of 260 mph in a southwestward direction, 
it would arrive in Los Angeles in about 10 hours. Only the 
rate of motion is indicated in the first example and denotes 
the speed of the aircraft. In the last example, the particular 
direction is included with the rate of motion, thus, denoting 
the velocity of the aircraft. 

Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. 
An aircraft increasing in velocity is an example of positive 
acceleration, while another aircraft reducing its velocity is an 
example of negative acceleration, or deceleration.

Newton’s Laws of Motion
The fundamental laws governing the action of air about a 
wing are known as Newton’s laws of motion. 

Newton’s first law is normally referred to as the law of 
inertia. It simply means that a body at rest does not move 
unless force is applied to it. If a body is moving at uniform

speed in a straight line, force must be applied to increase or 
decrease the speed. 

According to Newton’s law, since air has mass, it is a body. 
When an aircraft is on the ground with its engines off, inertia 
keeps the aircraft at rest. An aircraft is moved from its state 
of rest by the thrust force created by a propeller, or by the 
expanding exhaust, or both. When an aircraft is flying at 
uniform speed in a straight line, inertia tends to keep the 
aircraft moving. Some external force is required to change 
the aircraft from its path of flight. 

Newton’s second law states that if a body moving with 
uniform speed is acted upon by an external force, the change 
of motion is proportional to the amount of the force, and 
motion takes place in the direction in which the force acts. 
This law may be stated mathematically as follows: 

 Force = mass × acceleration (F = ma)

If an aircraft is flying against a headwind, it is slowed down. 
If the wind is coming from either side of the aircraft’s 
heading, the aircraft is pushed off course unless the pilot 
takes corrective action against the wind direction. 

Newton’s third law is the law of action and reaction. This 
law states that for every action (force) there is an equal 
and opposite reaction (force). This law can be illustrated 
by the example of firing a gun. The action is the forward 
movement of the bullet while the reaction is the backward 
recoil of the gun.

The three laws of motion that have been discussed apply to 
the theory of flight. In many cases, all three laws may be 
operating on an aircraft at the same time. 

Bernoulli’s Principle and Subsonic Flow
Bernoulli’s principle states that when a fluid (air) flowing 
through a tube reaches a constriction, or narrowing, of the 
tube, the speed of the fluid flowing through that constriction 
is increased and its pressure is decreased. The cambered 
(curved) surface of an airfoil (wing) affects the airflow 
exactly as a constriction in a tube affects airflow. [Figure 2-2] 
Diagram A of Figure 2-2 illustrates the effect of air passing 
through a constriction in a tube. In Diagram B, air is flowing 
past a cambered surface, such as an airfoil, and the effect is 
similar to that of air passing through a restriction. 

As the air flows over the upper surface of an airfoil, its 
velocity increases and its pressure decreases; an area of low 
pressure is formed. There is an area of greater pressure on 
the lower surface of the airfoil, and this greater pressure 
tends to move the wing upward. The difference in pressure 
between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing is called 
lift. Three-fourths of the total lift of an airfoil is the result of 
the decrease in pressure over the upper surface. The impact 
of air on the under surface of an airfoil produces the other 
one-fourth of the total lift.

Airfoil
An airfoil is a surface designed to obtain lift from the air 
through which it moves. Thus, it can be stated that any part 
of the aircraft that converts air resistance into lift is an airfoil.

The profile of a conventional wing is an excellent example 
of an airfoil. [Figure 2-3] Notice that the top surface of the 
wing profile has greater curvature than the lower surface. 

The difference in curvature of the upper and lower surfaces 
of the wing builds up the lift force. Air flowing over the top 
surface of the wing must reach the trailing edge of the wing 
in the same amount of time as the air flowing under the wing. 
To do this, the air passing over the top surface moves at a 
greater velocity than the air passing below the wing because 
of the greater distance it must travel along the top surface. 
This increased velocity, according to Bernoulli’s Principle, 
means a corresponding decrease in pressure on the surface. 
Thus, a pressure differential is created between the upper 
and lower surfaces of the wing, forcing the wing upward in 
the direction of the lower pressure. 

Within limits, lift can be increased by increasing the angle 
of attack (AOA), wing area, velocity, density of the air, or 
by changing the shape of the airfoil. When the force of lift 
on an aircraft’s wing equals the force of gravity, the aircraft 
maintains level flight.

Shape of the Airfoil
Individual airfoil section properties differ from those 
properties of the wing or aircraft as a whole because of the 
effect of the wing planform. A wing may have various airfoil 
sections from root to tip, with taper, twist, and sweepback. 
The resulting aerodynamic properties of the wing are 
determined by the action of each section along the span. 

The shape of the airfoil determines the amount of turbulence 
or skin friction that it produces, consequently affecting the 
efficiency of the wing. Turbulence and skin friction are 
controlled mainly by the fineness ratio, which is defined as the 
ratio of the chord of the airfoil to the maximum thickness. If 
the wing has a high fineness ratio, it is a very thin wing. A thick 
wing has a low fineness ratio. A wing with a high fineness 
ratio produces a large amount of skin friction. A wing with 
a low fineness ratio produces a large amount of turbulence. 
The best wing is a compromise between these two extremes 
to hold both turbulence and skin friction to a minimum. 

The efficiency of a wing is measured in terms of the lift to 
drag ratio (L/D). This ratio varies with the AOA but reaches a 
definite maximum value for a particular AOA. At this angle, 
the wing has reached its maximum efficiency. The shape of 
the airfoil is the factor that determines the AOA at which 
the wing is most efficient; it also determines the degree of 
efficiency. Research has shown that the most efficient airfoils 
for general use have the maximum thickness occurring about 
one-third of the way back from the leading edge of the wing. 

High-lift wings and high-lift devices for wings have been 
developed by shaping the airfoils to produce the desired effect. 
The amount of lift produced by an airfoil increases with an 
increase in wing camber. Camber refers to the curvature of an 
airfoil above and below the chord line surface. Upper camber 
refers to the upper surface, lower camber to the lower surface, 
and mean camber to the mean line of the section. Camber is 
positive when departure from the chord line is outward and 
negative when it is inward. Thus, high-lift wings have a large 
positive camber on the upper surface and a slightly negative 
camber on the lower surface. Wing flaps cause an ordinary 
wing to approximate this same condition by increasing the 
upper camber and by creating a negative lower camber. 

It is also known that the larger the wingspan, as compared 
to the chord, the greater the lift obtained. This comparison 
is called aspect ratio. The higher the aspect ratio, the greater 
the lift. In spite of the benefits from an increase in aspect 
ratio, it was found that definite limitations were defined by 
structural and drag considerations. 

On the other hand, an airfoil that is perfectly streamlined 
and offers little wind resistance sometimes does not have 
enough lifting power to take the aircraft off the ground. Thus, 
modern aircraft have airfoils which strike a medium between 
extremes, the shape depending on the purposes of the aircraft 
for which it is designed.

Angle of Incidence
The acute angle the wing chord makes with the longitudinal 
axis of the aircraft is called the angle of incidence, or the angle 
of wing setting. [Figure 2-4] The angle of incidence in most

cases is a fixed, built-in angle. When the leading edge of the 
wing is higher than the trailing edge, the angle of incidence is 
said to be positive. The angle of incidence is negative when 
the leading edge is lower than the trailing edge of the wing.

Angle of Attack (AOA)
Before beginning the discussion on AOA and its effect on 
airfoils, first consider the terms chord and center of pressure 
(CP) as illustrated in Figure 2-5.

The chord of an airfoil or wing section is an imaginary 
straight line that passes through the section from the leading 
edge to the trailing edge, as shown in Figure 2-5. The chord 
line provides one side of an angle that ultimately forms 
the AOA. The other side of the angle is formed by a line 
indicating the direction of the relative airstream. Thus, AOA 
is defined as the angle between the chord line of the wing and 
the direction of the relative wind. This is not to be confused 
with the angle of incidence, illustrated in Figure 2-4, which 
is the angle between the chord line of the wing and the 
longitudinal axis of the aircraft. 

On each part of an airfoil or wing surface, a small force is 
present. This force is of a different magnitude and direction 
from any forces acting on other areas forward or rearward 
from this point. It is possible to add all of these small forces 
mathematically. That sum is called the “resultant force” 
(lift). This resultant force has magnitude, direction, and 
location, and can be represented as a vector, as shown in 
Figure 2-5. The point of intersection of the resultant force 
line with the chord line of the airfoil is called the center of 
pressure (CP). The CP moves along the airfoil chord as the 
AOA changes. Throughout most of the flight range, the CP 
moves forward with increasing AOA and rearward as the 
AOA decreases. The effect of increasing AOA on the CP is 
shown in Figure 2-6. 

The AOA changes as the aircraft’s attitude changes. Since the 
AOA has a great deal to do with determining lift, it is given 
primary consideration when designing airfoils. In a properly 
designed airfoil, the lift increases as the AOA is increased. 

When the AOA is increased gradually toward a positive 
AOA, the lift component increases rapidly up to a certain 
point and then suddenly begins to drop off. During this action 
the drag component increases slowly at first, then rapidly as 
lift begins to drop off. 

When the AOA increases to the angle of maximum lift, the 
burble point is reached. This is known as the critical angle. 
When the critical angle is reached, the air ceases to flow 
smoothly over the top surface of the airfoil and begins to 
burble or eddy. This means that air breaks away from the 
upper camber line of the wing. What was formerly the area 
of decreased pressure is now filled by this burbling air. 
When this occurs, the amount of lift drops and drag becomes

excessive. The force of gravity exerts itself, and the nose of 
the aircraft drops. This is a stall. Thus, the burble point is 
the stalling angle. 

As previously seen, the distribution of the pressure forces 
over the airfoil varies with the AOA. The application of the 
resultant force, or CP, varies correspondingly. As this angle 
increases, the CP moves forward; as the angle decreases, the 
CP moves back. The unstable travel of the CP is characteristic 
of almost all airfoils.

Boundary Layer
In the study of physics and fluid mechanics, a boundary layer 
is that layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding 
surface. In relation to an aircraft, the boundary layer is the 
part of the airflow closest to the surface of the aircraft. In 
designing high-performance aircraft, considerable attention 
is paid to controlling the behavior of the boundary layer to 
minimize pressure drag and skin friction drag. 
 
Thrust and Drag
An aircraft in flight is the center of a continuous battle of 
forces. Actually, this conflict is not as violent as it sounds, 
but it is the key to all maneuvers performed in the air. There 
is nothing mysterious about these forces; they are definite and 
known. The directions in which they act can be calculated, 
and the aircraft itself is designed to take advantage of each 
of them. In all types of flying, flight calculations are based 
on the magnitude and direction of four forces: weight, lift, 
drag, and thrust. [Figure 2-7]

An aircraft in flight is acted upon by four forces:

1. Gravity or weight—the force that pulls the aircraft 
toward the earth. Weight is the force of gravity acting 
downward upon everything that goes into the aircraft, 
such as the aircraft itself, crew, fuel, and cargo. 

2. Lift—the force that pushes the aircraft upward. Lift 
acts vertically and counteracts the effects of weight. 

3. Thrust—the force that moves the aircraft forward. 
Thrust is the forward force produced by the powerplant 
that overcomes the force of drag.

4. Drag—the force that exerts a braking action to hold 
the aircraft back. Drag is a backward deterrent force 
and is caused by the disruption of the airflow by the 
wings, fuselage, and protruding objects. 

These four forces are in perfect balance only when the aircraft 
is in straight-and-level unaccelerated flight. 

The forces of lift and drag are the direct result of the 
relationship between the relative wind and the aircraft. The 
force of lift always acts perpendicular to the relative wind, 
and the force of drag always acts parallel to and in the same 
direction as the relative wind. These forces are actually the 
components that produce a resultant lift force on the wing. 
[Figure 2-8]

Weight has a definite relationship with lift, and thrust with 
drag. These relationships are quite simple, but very important 
in understanding the aerodynamics of flying. As stated 
previously, lift is the upward force on the wing perpendicular 
to the relative wind. Lift is required to counteract the aircraft’s 
weight, caused by the force of gravity acting on the mass of 
the aircraft. This weight force acts downward through a point 
called the center of gravity (CG). The CG is the point at which 
all the weight of the aircraft is considered to be concentrated. 
When the lift force is in equilibrium with the weight force, 
the aircraft neither gains nor loses altitude. If lift becomes 
less than weight, the aircraft loses altitude. When the lift is 
greater than the weight, the aircraft gains altitude. 

Wing area is measured in square feet and includes the 
part blanked out by the fuselage. Wing area is adequately 
described as the area of the shadow cast by the wing at high 
noon. Tests show that lift and drag forces acting on a wing 
are roughly proportional to the wing area. This means that 


2-8

Vor
tex

Figure 2-9. Wingtip vortices. 

if the wing area is doubled, all other variables remaining the 
same, the lift and drag created by the wing is doubled. If the 
area is tripled, lift and drag are tripled.

Drag must be overcome for the aircraft to move, and 
movement is essential to obtain lift. To overcome drag and 
move the aircraft forward, another force is essential. This 
force is thrust. Thrust is derived from jet propulsion or from 
a propeller and engine combination. Jet propulsion theory is 
based on Newton’s third law of motion (page 2-4). The turbine 
engine causes a mass of air to be moved backward at high 
velocity causing a reaction that moves the aircraft forward. 

In a propeller/engine combination, the propeller is actually 
two or more revolving airfoils mounted on a horizontal shaft. 
The motion of the blades through the air produces lift similar 
to the lift on the wing, but acts in a horizontal direction, 
pulling the aircraft forward. 

Before the aircraft begins to move, thrust must be exerted. 
The aircraft continues to move and gain speed until thrust and 
drag are equal. In order to maintain a steady speed, thrust and 
drag must remain equal, just as lift and weight must be equal 
for steady, horizontal flight. Increasing the lift means that the 
aircraft moves upward, whereas decreasing the lift so that it 
is less than the weight causes the aircraft to lose altitude. A 
similar rule applies to the two forces of thrust and drag. If 
the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the engine is reduced, the 
thrust is lessened, and the aircraft slows down. As long as the 
thrust is less than the drag, the aircraft travels more and more 
slowly until its speed is insufficient to support it in the air. 

Likewise, if the rpm of the engine is increased, thrust becomes 
greater than drag, and the speed of the aircraft increases. As 
long as the thrust continues to be greater than the drag, the 
aircraft continues to accelerate. When drag equals thrust, the 
aircraft flies at a steady speed. 

The relative motion of the air over an object that produces 
lift also produces drag. Drag is the resistance of the air to 
objects moving through it. If an aircraft is flying on a level 
course, the lift force acts vertically to support it while the 
drag force acts horizontally to hold it back. The total amount 
of drag on an aircraft is made up of many drag forces, but 
this handbook considers three: parasite drag, profile drag, 
and induced drag. 

Parasite drag is made up of a combination of many different 
drag forces. Any exposed object on an aircraft offers some 
resistance to the air, and the more objects in the airstream, 
the more parasite drag. While parasite drag can be reduced 
by reducing the number of exposed parts to as few as 
practical and streamlining their shape, skin friction is the 

type of parasite drag most difficult to reduce. No surface is 
perfectly smooth. Even machined surfaces have a ragged 
uneven appearance when inspected under magnification. 
These ragged surfaces deflect the air near the surface causing 
resistance to smooth airflow. Skin friction can be reduced 
by using glossy smooth finishes and eliminating protruding 
rivet heads, roughness, and other irregularities.

Profile drag may be considered the parasite drag of the airfoil. 
The various components of parasite drag are all of the same 
nature as profile drag. 

The action of the airfoil that creates lift also causes induced 
drag. Remember, the pressure above the wing is less than 
atmospheric pressure, and the pressure below the wing is 
equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure. Since fluids 
always move from high pressure toward low pressure, there 
is a spanwise movement of air from the bottom of the wing 
outward from the fuselage and upward around the wing tip. 
This flow of air results in spillage over the wing tip, thereby 
setting up a whirlpool of air called a “vortex.” [Figure 2-9] 

The air on the upper surface has a tendency to move in toward 
the fuselage and off the trailing edge. This air current forms a 
similar vortex at the inner portion of the trailing edge of the 
wing. These vortices increase drag because of the turbulence 
produced, and constitute induced drag. 

Just as lift increases with an increase in AOA, induced drag 
also increases as the AOA becomes greater. This occurs 
because, as the AOA is increased, the pressure difference 
between the top and bottom of the wing becomes greater. 
This causes more violent vortices to be set up, resulting in 
more turbulence and more induced drag.

Center of Gravity (CG)
Gravity is the pulling force that tends to draw all bodies 
within the earth’s gravitational field to the center of the 
earth. The CG may be considered the point at which all the 
weight of the aircraft is concentrated. If the aircraft were 
supported at its exact CG, it would balance in any position. 
CG is of major importance in an aircraft, for its position has 
a great bearing upon stability. 

The CG is determined by the general design of the aircraft. 
The designers estimate how far the CP travels. They then 
fix the CG in front of the CP for the corresponding flight 
speed in order to provide an adequate restoring moment for 
flight equilibrium. 

The Axes of an Aircraft 
Whenever an aircraft changes its attitude in flight, it must 
turn about one or more of three axes. Figure 2-10 shows the 
three axes, which are imaginary lines passing through the 
center of the aircraft. 

The axes of an aircraft can be considered as imaginary axles 
around which the aircraft turns like a wheel. At the center, 
where all three axes intersect, each is perpendicular to the 
other two. The axis that extends lengthwise through the 
fuselage from the nose to the tail is called the longitudinal 
axis. The axis that extends crosswise from wing tip to wing 
tip is the lateral, or pitch, axis. The axis that passes through 
the center, from top to bottom, is called the vertical, or yaw, 
axis. Roll, pitch, and yaw are controlled by three control 
surfaces. Roll is produced by the ailerons, which are located 
at the trailing edges of the wings. Pitch is affected by the 
elevators, the rear portion of the horizontal tail assembly. 
Yaw is controlled by the rudder, the rear portion of the 
vertical tail assembly. 

Stability and Control 
An aircraft must have sufficient stability to maintain a 
uniform flightpath and recover from the various upsetting 
forces. Also, to achieve the best performance, the aircraft 
must have the proper response to the movement of the 
controls. Control is the pilot action of moving the flight 
controls, providing the aerodynamic force that induces the 
aircraft to follow a desired flightpath. When an aircraft is 
said to be controllable, it means that the aircraft responds 
easily and promptly to movement of the controls. Different 
control surfaces are used to control the aircraft about each 
of the three axes. Moving the control surfaces on an aircraft 
changes the airflow over the aircraft’s surface. This, in turn, 
creates changes in the balance of forces acting to keep the 
aircraft flying straight and level.

Three terms that appear in any discussion of stability and 
control are: stability, maneuverability, and controllability. 
Stability is the characteristic of an aircraft that tends to 
cause it to fly (hands off) in a straight-and-level flightpath. 
Maneuverability is the characteristic of an aircraft to be 
directed along a desired flightpath and to withstand the 
stresses imposed. Controllability is the quality of the response 
of an aircraft to the pilot’s commands while maneuvering 
the aircraft. 

Static Stability
An aircraft is in a state of equilibrium when the sum of all the 
forces acting on the aircraft and all the moments is equal to 
zero. An aircraft in equilibrium experiences no accelerations, 
and the aircraft continues in a steady condition of flight. 
A gust of wind or a deflection of the controls disturbs the 
equilibrium, and the aircraft experiences acceleration due to 
the unbalance of moment or force. 

The three types of static stability are defined by the character 
of movement following some disturbance from equilibrium. 
Positive static stability exists when the disturbed object tends 
to return to equilibrium. Negative static stability, or static 
instability, exists when the disturbed object tends to continue 
in the direction of disturbance. Neutral static stability exists 
when the disturbed object has neither tendency, but remains 
in equilibrium in the direction of disturbance. These three 
types of stability are illustrated in Figure 2-11. 

Dynamic Stability
While static stability deals with the tendency of a displaced 
body to return to equilibrium, dynamic stability deals with 
the resulting motion with time. If an object is disturbed from 
equilibrium, the time history of the resulting motion defines 
the dynamic stability of the object. In general, an object 
demonstrates positive dynamic stability if the amplitude 
of motion decreases with time. If the amplitude of motion 
increases with time, the object is said to possess dynamic 
instability. 

Any aircraft must demonstrate the required degrees of static 
and dynamic stability. If an aircraft were designed with static 
instability and a rapid rate of dynamic instability, the aircraft 
would be very difficult, if not impossible, to fly. Usually, 
positive dynamic stability is required in an aircraft design to 
prevent objectionable continued oscillations of the aircraft. 

Longitudinal Stability
When an aircraft has a tendency to keep a constant AOA 
with reference to the relative wind (i.e., it does not tend to 
put its nose down and dive or lift its nose and stall); it is said 
to have longitudinal stability. Longitudinal stability refers

surface which controls longitudinal stability. The action of 
the stabilizer depends upon the speed and AOA of the aircraft. 

Directional Stability
Stability about the vertical axis is referred to as directional 
stability. The aircraft should be designed so that when it is

in straight-and-level flight it remains on its course heading 
even though the pilot takes his or her hands and feet off the 
controls. If an aircraft recovers automatically from a skid, it 
has been well designed for directional balance. The vertical 
stabilizer is the primary surface that controls directional 
stability. Directional stability can be designed into an aircraft, 
where appropriate, by using a large dorsal fin, a long fuselage, 
and sweptback wings. 

Lateral Stability
Motion about the aircraft’s longitudinal (fore and aft) axis 
is a lateral, or rolling, motion. The tendency to return to the 
original attitude from such motion is called lateral stability. 

Dutch Roll
A Dutch Roll is an aircraft motion consisting of an out-of-
phase combination of yaw and roll. Dutch roll stability can 
be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. 

Primary Flight Controls
The primary controls are the ailerons, elevator, and the 
rudder, which provide the aerodynamic force to make the 
aircraft follow a desired flightpath. [Figure 2-10] The flight 
control surfaces are hinged or movable airfoils designed to 
change the attitude of the aircraft by changing the airflow 
over the aircraft’s surface during flight. These surfaces are 
used for moving the aircraft about its three axes.

Typically, the ailerons and elevators are operated from the 
flight deck by means of a control stick, a wheel, and yoke 
assembly and on some of the newer design aircraft, a joy-

stick. The rudder is normally operated by foot pedals on most 
aircraft. Lateral control is the banking movement or roll of an 
aircraft that is controlled by the ailerons. Longitudinal control 
is the climb and dive movement or pitch of an aircraft that 
is controlled by the elevator. Directional control is the left 
and right movement or yaw of an aircraft that is controlled 
by the rudder. 

Trim Controls
Included in the trim controls are the trim tabs, servo tabs, 
balance tabs, and spring tabs. Trim tabs are small airfoils 
recessed into the trailing edges of the primary control 
surfaces. [Figure 2-12] Trim tabs can be used to correct any 
tendency of the aircraft to move toward an undesirable flight

attitude. Their purpose is to enable the pilot to trim out any 
unbalanced condition which may exist during flight, without 
exerting any pressure on the primary controls.

Servo tabs, sometimes referred to as flight tabs, are used 
primarily on the large main control surfaces. They aid in 
moving the main control surface and holding it in the desired 
position. Only the servo tab moves in response to movement 
by the pilot of the primary flight controls. 

Balance tabs are designed to move in the opposite direction 
of the primary flight control. Thus, aerodynamic forces acting 
on the tab assist in moving the primary control surface.

Spring tabs are similar in appearance to trim tabs, but serve an 
entirely different purpose. Spring tabs are used for the same 
purpose as hydraulic actuators—to aid the pilot in moving 
the primary control surface. 

Figure 2-13 indicates how each trim tab is hinged to its parent 
primary control surface, but is operated by an independent 
control.

Auxiliary Lift Devices
Included in the auxiliary lift devices group of flight control 
surfaces are the wing flaps, spoilers, speed brakes, slats, 
leading edge flaps, and slots. 

The auxiliary groups may be divided into two subgroups: 
those whose primary purpose is lift augmenting and those 
whose primary purpose is lift decreasing. In the first group are 
the flaps, both trailing edge and leading edge (slats), and slots. 
The lift decreasing devices are speed brakes and spoilers. 

Lift Augmenting
Flaps are located on the trailing edge of the wing and are 
moveable to increase the wing area, thereby increasing lift 
on takeoff, and decreasing the speed during landing. These 
airfoils are retractable and fair into the wing contour. Others 
are simply a portion of the lower skin which extends into 
the airstream, thereby slowing the aircraft. Leading edge 
flaps, also referred to as slats, are airfoils extended from and 
retracted into the leading edge of the wing.  Some installations
create a slot (an opening between the extended airfoil and the
leading edge). [Figure 2-14] At low airspeeds, this slot 
increases lift and improves handling characteristics, allowing 
the aircraft to be controlled at airspeeds below the normal 
landing speed.  

Other installations have permanent slots built in the leading
edge of the wing. At cruising speeds, the trailing edge and 
leading edge flaps (slats) are retracted into the wing proper. 
Slats are movable control surfaces attached to the leading 

edges of the wings. When the slat is closed, it forms the 
leading edge of the wing. When in the open position (extended 
forward), a slot is created between the slat and the wing 
leading edge. At low airspeeds, this increases lift and improves 
handling characteristics, allowing the aircraft to be controlled 
at airspeeds below the normal landing  speed. [Figure 2-15]

Lift Decreasing
Lift decreasing devices are the speed brakes (spoilers). In 
some installations, there are two types of spoilers. The ground 
spoiler is extended only after the aircraft is on the ground, 
thereby assisting in the braking action. The flight spoiler 
assists in lateral control by being extended whenever the 
aileron on that wing is rotated up. When actuated as speed 
brakes, the spoiler panels on both wings raise up. In-flight 
spoilers may also be located along the sides, underneath the 
fuselage, or back at the tail. [Figure 2-16] In some aircraft 
designs, the wing panel on the up aileron side rises more than

Winglets
Winglets are the near-vertical extension of the wingtip 
that reduces the aerodynamic drag associated with vortices 
that develop at the wingtips as the airplane moves through 
the air. By reducing the induced drag at the tips of the 
wings, fuel consumption goes down and range is extended. 
Figure 2-17 shows an example of a Learjet 60 with winglets.

Canard Wings
A canard wing aircraft is an airframe configuration of a fixed-
wing aircraft in which a small wing or horizontal airfoil is 
ahead of the main lifting surfaces, rather than behind them as 
in a conventional aircraft. The canard may be fixed, movable, 
or designed with elevators. Good examples of aircraft with 
canard wings are the Rutan VariEze and Beechcraft 2000 
Starship. [Figures 2-18 and 2-19]

Wing Fences 
Wing fences are flat metal vertical plates fixed to the upper 
surface of the wing. They obstruct spanwise airflow along 
the wing, and prevent the entire wing from stalling at once. 
They are often attached on swept-wing aircraft to prevent the 
spanwise movement of air at high AOA. Their purpose is to 
provide better slow speed handling and stall characteristics. 
[Figure 2-20] 
  
Control Systems for Large Aircraft
Mechanical Control
This is the basic type of system that was used to control 
early aircraft and is currently used in smaller aircraft where 
aerodynamic forces are not excessive. The controls are 
mechanical and manually operated.

The mechanical system of controlling an aircraft can include 
cables, push-pull tubes, and torque tubes. The cable system is 
the most widely used because deflections of the structure to 
which it is attached do not affect its operation. Some aircraft 
incorporate control systems that are a combination of all three. 

These systems incorporate cable assemblies, cable guides, 
linkage, adjustable stops, and control surface snubber or 
mechanical locking devices. These surface locking devices, 
usually referred to as a gust lock, limits the external wind forces 
from damaging the aircraft while it is parked or tied down. 

Hydromechanical Control
As the size, complexity, and speed of aircraft increased, 
actuation of controls in flight became more difficult. It soon 
became apparent that the pilot needed assistance to overcome 
the aerodynamic forces to control aircraft movement. Spring 
tabs, which were operated by the conventional control 
system, were moved so that the airflow over them actually 
moved the primary control surface. This was sufficient 
for the aircraft operating in the lowest of the high speed 
ranges (250–300 mph). For higher speeds, a power-assisted 
(hydraulic) control system was designed.

Conventional cable or push-pull tube systems link the 
flight deck controls with the hydraulic system. With the 
system activated, the pilot’s movement of a control causes 
the mechanical link to open servo valves, thereby directing 
hydraulic fluid to actuators, which convert hydraulic pressure 
into control surface movements.

Because of the efficiency of the hydromechanical flight 
control system, the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces 
cannot be felt by the pilot, and there is a risk of overstressing 
the structure of the aircraft. To overcome this problem, 
aircraft designers incorporated artificial feel systems into the 
design that provided increased resistance to the controls at 
higher speeds. Additionally, some aircraft with hydraulically 
powered control systems are fitted with a device called a stick 
shaker, which provides an artificial stall warning to the pilot. 

Fly-By-Wire Control 
The fly-by-wire (FBW) control system employs electrical 
signals that transmit the pilot’s actions from the flight deck 


2-15

Figure 2-21. Breaking the sound barrier. 

through a computer to the various flight control actuators. 
The FBW system evolved as a way to reduce the system 
weight of the hydromechanical system, reduce maintenance 
costs, and improve reliability. Electronic FBW control 
systems can respond to changing aerodynamic conditions 
by adjusting flight control movements so that the aircraft 
response is consistent for all flight conditions. Additionally, 
the computers can be programmed to prevent undesirable 
and dangerous characteristics, such as stalling and spinning.

Many of the new military high-performance aircraft are not 
aerodynamically stable. This characteristic is designed into 
the aircraft for increased maneuverability and responsive 
performance. Without the computers reacting to the 
instability, the pilot would lose control of the aircraft. 

The Airbus A-320 was the first commercial airliner to use 
FBW controls. Boeing used them in their 777 and newer 
design commercial aircraft. The Dassault Falcon 7X was the 
first business jet to use a FBW control system.

High-Speed Aerodynamics
High-speed aerodynamics, often called compressible 
aerodynamics, is a special branch of study of aeronautics. 
It is utilized by aircraft designers when designing aircraft 
capable of speeds approaching Mach 1 and above. Because 
it is beyond the scope and intent of this handbook, only a 
brief overview of the subject is provided.

In the study of high-speed aeronautics, the compressibility 
effects on air must be addressed. This flight regime is 
characterized by the Mach number, a special parameter named 
in honor of Ernst Mach, the late 19th century physicist who 
studied gas dynamics. Mach number is the ratio of the speed 
of the aircraft to the local speed of sound and determines the 
magnitude of many of the compressibility effects. 

As an aircraft moves through the air, the air molecules near 
the aircraft are disturbed and move around the aircraft. The 
air molecules are pushed aside much like a boat creates a bow 
wave as it moves through the water. If the aircraft passes at a 
low speed, typically less than 250 mph, the density of the air 
remains constant. But at higher speeds, some of the energy of 
the aircraft goes into compressing the air and locally changing 
the density of the air. The bigger and heavier the aircraft, the 
more air it displaces and the greater effect compression has 
on the aircraft. 

This effect becomes more important as speed increases. Near 
and beyond the speed of sound, about 760 mph (at sea level), 
sharp disturbances generate a shockwave that affects both the 
lift and drag of an aircraft and flow conditions downstream of 
the shockwave. The shockwave forms a cone of pressurized 

air molecules which move outward and rearward in all 
directions and extend to the ground. The sharp release of the 
pressure, after the buildup by the shockwave, is heard as the 
sonic boom. [Figure 2-21]

Listed below are a range of conditions that are encountered 
by aircraft as their designed speed increases. 

• Subsonic conditions occur for Mach numbers less 
than one (100–350 mph). For the lowest subsonic 
conditions, compressibility can be ignored.

• As the speed of the object approaches the speed of 
sound, the flight Mach number is nearly equal to 
one, M = 1 (350–760 mph), and the flow is said 
to be transonic. At some locations on the object, 
the local speed of air exceeds the speed of sound. 
Compressibility effects are most important in 
transonic flows and lead to the early belief in a sound 
barrier. Flight faster than sound was thought to be 
impossible. In fact, the sound barrier was only an 
increase in the drag near sonic conditions because 
of compressibility effects. Because of the high drag 
associated with compressibility effects, aircraft are 
not operated in cruise conditions near Mach 1. 

• Supersonic conditions occur for numbers greater 
than Mach 1, but less then Mach 3 (760–2,280 
mph). Compressibility effects of gas are important 
in the design of supersonic aircraft because of the 
shockwaves that are generated by the surface of the 
object. For high supersonic speeds, between Mach 3 
and Mach 5 (2,280–3,600 mph), aerodynamic heating 
becomes a very important factor in aircraft design. 

• For speeds greater than Mach 5, the flow is said to 
be hypersonic. At these speeds, some of the energy 
of the object now goes into exciting the chemical 
bonds which hold together the nitrogen and oxygen 
molecules of the air. At hypersonic speeds, the

chemistry of the air must be considered when 
determining forces on the object. When the space 
shuttle re-enters the atmosphere at high hypersonic 
speeds, close to Mach 25, the heated air becomes an 
ionized plasma of gas, and the spacecraft must be 
insulated from the extremely high temperatures. 

Additional technical information pertaining to high-speed 
aerodynamics can be found at bookstores, libraries, and 
numerous sources on the Internet. As the design of aircraft 
evolves and the speeds of aircraft continue to increase into 
the hypersonic range, new materials and propulsion systems 
will need to be developed. This is the challenge for engineers, 
physicists, and designers of aircraft in the future. 

Rotary-Wing Aircraft Assembly and Rigging
The flight control units located in the flight deck of all 
helicopters are very nearly the same. All helicopters have 
either one or two of each of the following: collective pitch 
control, throttle grip, cyclic pitch control, and directional 
control pedals. [Figure 2-22] Basically, these units do the 
same things, regardless of the type of helicopter on which 
they are installed; however, the operation of the control 
system varies greatly by helicopter model. 

Rigging the helicopter coordinates the movements of the 
flight controls and establishes the relationship between the 
main rotor and its controls, and between the tail rotor and its 
controls. Rigging is not a difficult job, but it requires great 
precision and attention to detail. Strict adherence to rigging 
procedures described in the manufacturer’s maintenance 
manuals and service instructions is a must. Adjustments, 
clearances, and tolerances must be exact. 

Rigging of the various flight control systems can be broken 
down into the following three major steps: 

1. Placing the control system in a specific position—
holding it in position with pins, clamps, or jigs, then 
adjusting the various linkages to fit the immobilized 
control component. 

2. Placing the control surfaces in a specific reference 
position—using a rigging jig, a precision bubble 
protractor, or a spirit level to check the angular 
difference between the control surface and some fixed 
surface on the aircraft. [Figure 2-23]

3. Setting the maximum range of travel of the various 
components—this adjustment limits the physical 
movement of the control system.

After completion of the static rigging, a functional check of 
the flight control system must be accomplished. The nature 
of the functional check varies with the type of helicopter and 
system concerned, but usually includes determining that: 

1. The direction of movement of the main and tail rotor 
blades is correct in relation to movement of the pilot’s 
controls. 

2. The operation of interconnected control systems 
(engine throttle and collective pitch) is properly 
coordinated. 

3. The range of movement and neutral position of the 
pilot’s controls are correct. 

4. The maximum and minimum pitch angles of the main 
rotor blades are within specified limits. This includes 
checking the fore-and-aft and lateral cyclic pitch and 
collective pitch blade angles. 

5. The tracking of the main rotor blades is correct. 

6. In the case of multirotor aircraft, the rigging and 
movement of the rotor blades are synchronized.

7. When tabs are provided on main rotor blades, they 
are correctly set. 

8. The neutral, maximum, and minimum pitch angles 
and coning angles of the tail rotor blades are correct. 

9. When dual controls are provided, they function 
correctly and in synchronization. 

Upon completion of rigging, a thorough check should be made 
of all attaching, securing, and pivot points. All bolts, nuts, and 
rod ends should be properly secured and safetied as specified 
in the manufacturers’ maintenance and service instructions.

Configurations of Rotary-Wing Aircraft
Autogyro
An autogyro is an aircraft with a free-spinning horizontal 
rotor that turns due to passage of air upward through the 
rotor. This air motion is created from forward motion of the 
aircraft resulting from either a tractor or pusher configured 
engine/propeller design. [Figure 2-24]

Single Rotor Helicopter
An aircraft with a single horizontal main rotor that provides 
both lift and direction of travel is a single rotor helicopter. 
A secondary rotor mounted vertically on the tail counteracts 
the rotational force (torque) of the main rotor to correct yaw 
of the fuselage. [Figure 2-25]

Dual Rotor Helicopter
An aircraft with two horizontal rotors that provide both the 
lift and directional control is a dual rotor helicopter. The 
rotors are counterrotating to balance the aerodynamic torque 
and eliminate the need for a separate antitorque system. 
[Figure 2-26]

Types of Rotor Systems
Fully Articulated Rotor
A fully articulated rotor is found on aircraft with more than 
two blades and allows movement of each individual blade in 
three directions. In this design, each blade can rotate about 
the pitch axis to change lift; each blade can move back and 
forth in plane, lead and lag; and flap up and down through a 
hinge independent of the other blades. [Figure 2-27] 

Semirigid Rotor
The semirigid rotor design is found on aircraft with two rotor 
blades. The blades are connected in a manner such that as 
one blade flaps up, the opposite blade flaps down.

Rigid Rotor
The rigid rotor system is a rare design but potentially offers 
the best properties of both the fully articulated and semirigid 
rotors. In this design, the blade roots are rigidly attached to the 
rotor hub. The blades do not have hinges to allow lead-lag or 
flapping. Instead, the blades accommodate these motions by 
using elastomeric bearings. Elastomeric bearings are molded, 
rubber-like materials that are bonded to the appropriate parts. 
Instead of rotating like conventional bearings, they twist and 
flex to allow proper movement of the blades. 

Forces Acting on the Helicopter
One of the differences between a helicopter and a fixed-wing 
aircraft is the main source of lift. The fixed-wing aircraft 
derives its lift from a fixed airfoil surface while the helicopter 
derives lift from a rotating airfoil called the rotor. 

During hovering flight in a no-wind condition, the tip-path 
plane is horizontal, that is, parallel to the ground. Lift and 
thrust act straight up; weight and drag act straight down. The 
sum of the lift and thrust forces must equal the sum of the 
weight and drag forces in order for the helicopter to hover. 

During vertical flight in a no-wind condition, the lift and 
thrust forces both act vertically upward. Weight and drag both 
act vertically downward. When lift and thrust equal weight 
and drag, the helicopter hovers; if lift and thrust are less than 
weight and drag, the helicopter descends vertically; if lift 
and thrust are greater than weight and drag, the helicopter 
rises vertically. 

For forward flight, the tip-path plane is tilted forward, thus 
tilting the total lift-thrust force forward from the vertical. This 
resultant lift-thrust force can be resolved into two components: 
lift acting vertically upward and thrust acting horizontally in 
the direction of flight. In addition to lift and thrust, there is 
weight, the downward acting force, and drag, the rearward 
acting or retarding force of inertia and wind resistance. 

In straight-and-level, unaccelerated forward flight, lift equals 
weight and thrust equals drag. (Straight-and-level flight is 
flight with a constant heading and at a constant altitude.) 
If lift exceeds weight, the helicopter climbs; if lift is less 
than weight, the helicopter descends. If thrust exceeds drag, 
the helicopter increases speed; if thrust is less than drag, it 
decreases speed.


2-19

Figure 2-28. Aerospatiale Fenestron tail rotor system (left) and the McDonnell Douglas NOTAR® System (right).

In sideward flight, the tip-path plane is tilted sideward in the 
direction that flight is desired, thus tilting the total lift-thrust 
vector sideward. In this case, the vertical or lift component 
is still straight up, weight straight down, but the horizontal 
or thrust component now acts sideward with drag acting to 
the opposite side. 

For rearward flight, the tip-path plane is tilted rearward and 
tilts the lift-thrust vector rearward. The thrust is then rearward 
and the drag component is forward, opposite that for forward 
flight. The lift component in rearward flight is straight up; 
weight, straight down. 

Torque Compensation
Newton’s third law of motion states “To every action there 
is an equal and opposite reaction.” As the main rotor of a 
helicopter turns in one direction, the fuselage tends to rotate 
in the opposite direction. This tendency for the fuselage to 
rotate is called torque. Since torque effect on the fuselage is 
a direct result of engine power supplied to the main rotor, 
any change in engine power brings about a corresponding 
change in torque effect. The greater the engine power, the 
greater the torque effect. Since there is no engine power 
being supplied to the main rotor during autorotation, there 
is no torque reaction during autorotation. 

The force that compensates for torque and provides for 
directional control can be produced by various means. The 
defining factor is dictated by the design of the helicopter, 
some of which do not have a torque issue. Single main 

rotor designs typically have an auxiliary rotor located on 
the end of the tail boom. This auxiliary rotor, generally 
referred to as a tail rotor, produces thrust in the direction 
opposite the torque reaction developed by the main rotor. 
[Figure 2-25] Foot pedals in the flight deck permit the 
pilot to increase or decrease tail rotor thrust, as needed, to 
neutralize torque effect. 

Other methods of compensating for torque and providing 
directional control include the Fenestron® tail rotor system, 
an SUD Aviation design that employs a ducted fan enclosed 
by a shroud. Another design, called NOTAR®, a McDonald 
Douglas design with no tail rotor, employs air directed 
through a series of slots in the tail boom, with the balance 
exiting through a 90° duct located at the rear of the tail boom. 
[Figure 2-28]

Gyroscopic Forces
The spinning main rotor of a helicopter acts like a gyroscope. 
As such, it has the properties of gyroscopic action, one of 
which is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the resultant 
action or deflection of a spinning object when a force is 
applied to this object. This action occurs approximately 90° 
in the direction of rotation from the point where the force 
is applied. [Figure 2-29] Through the use of this principle, 
the tip-path plane of the main rotor may be tilted from the 
horizontal.

Gyro tips up hereUpward force applied here Reaction occurs here Gyro tips down here

Figure 2-29. Gyroscopic precession principle.

Examine a two-bladed rotor system to see how gyroscopic 
precession affects the movement of the tip-path plane. Moving 
the cyclic pitch control increases the AOA of one rotor blade 
with the result that a greater lifting force is applied at that 
point in the plane of rotation. This same control movement 
simultaneously decreases the AOA of the other blade the same 
amount, thus decreasing the lifting force applied at that point 
in the plane of rotation. The blade with the increased AOA 
tends to flap up; the blade with the decreased AOA tends to 
flap down. Because the rotor disk acts like a gyro, the blades 
reach maximum deflection at a point approximately 90° 
later in the plane of rotation. As shown in Figure 2-30, the 
retreating blade AOA is increased and the advancing blade 
AOA is decreased resulting in a tipping forward of the tip-path 
plane, since maximum deflection takes place 90° later when 
the blades are at the rear and front, respectively. In a rotor 
system using three or more blades, the movement of the cyclic 
pitch control changes the AOA of each blade an appropriate 
amount so that the end result is the same.

The movement of the cyclic pitch control in a two-bladed 
rotor system increases the AOA of one rotor blade with 
the result that a greater lifting force is applied at this point 
in the plane of rotation. This same control movement 
simultaneously decreases the AOA of the other blade a like 
amount, thus decreasing the lifting force applied at this point 
in the plane of rotation. The blade with the increased AOA 
tends to rise; the blade with the decreased AOA tends to 
lower. However, gyroscopic precession prevents the blades 
from rising or lowering to maximum deflection until a point 
approximately 90° later in the plane of rotation. 

In a three-bladed rotor, the movement of the cyclic pitch 
control changes the AOA of each blade an appropriate 
amount so that the end result is the same, a tipping forward 
of the tip-path plane when the maximum change in AOA 
is made as each blade passes the same points at which the 
maximum increase and decrease are made for the two-
bladed rotor as shown in Figure 2-30. As each blade passes 
the 90° position on the left, the maximum increase in AOA 
occurs. As each blade passes the 90° position to the right, 
the maximum decrease in AOA occurs. Maximum deflection 
takes place 90° later, maximum upward deflection at the rear 
and maximum downward deflection at the front; the tip-path 
plane tips forward.

Helicopter Flight Conditions 
Hovering Flight
During hovering flight, a helicopter maintains a constant 
position over a selected point, usually a few feet above the 
ground. For a helicopter to hover, the lift and thrust produced 
by the rotor system act straight up and must equal the weight 
and drag, which act straight down. [Figure 2-31] While 
hovering, the amount of main rotor thrust can be changed 
to maintain the desired hovering altitude. This is done by 
changing the angle of incidence (by moving the collective) 
of the rotor blades and hence the AOA of the main rotor 
blades. Changing the AOA changes the drag on the rotor 
blades, and the power delivered by the engine must change 
as well to keep the rotor speed constant. 

The weight that must be supported is the total weight of the 
helicopter and its occupants. If the amount of lift is greater

than the actual weight, the helicopter accelerates upwards 
until the lift force equals the weight gain altitude; if thrust is 
less than weight, the helicopter accelerates downward. When 
operating near the ground, the effect of the closeness to the 
ground changes this response. 

The drag of a hovering helicopter is mainly induced drag 
incurred while the blades are producing lift. There is, 
however, some profile drag on the blades as they rotate 
through the air. Throughout the rest of this discussion, the 
term drag includes both induced and profile drag.

An important consequence of producing thrust is torque. As 
discussed earlier, Newton’s third law states that for every 
action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, as 
the engine turns the main rotor system in a counterclockwise 
direction, the helicopter fuselage tends to turn clockwise. The 
amount of torque is directly related to the amount of engine 
power being used to turn the main rotor system. Remember, 
as power changes, torque changes.

To counteract this torque-induced turning tendency, an 
antitorque rotor or tail rotor is incorporated into most 
helicopter designs. A pilot can vary the amount of thrust 
produced by the tail rotor in relation to the amount of torque 
produced by the engine. As the engine supplies more power 
to the main rotor, the tail rotor must produce more thrust to 
overcome the increased torque effect. This is done through 
the use of antitorque pedals.

Figure 2-32. A tail rotor is designed to produce thrust in a direction 
opposite torque. The thrust produced by the tail rotor is sufficient 
to move the helicopter laterally.

Translating Tendency or Drift
During hovering flight, a single main rotor helicopter tends to 
drift or move in the direction of tail rotor thrust. This drifting 
tendency is called translating tendency. [Figure 2-32] 

To counteract this drift, one or more of the following features 
may be used. All examples are for a counterclockwise rotating 
main rotor system.

• The main transmission is mounted at a slight angle to 
the left (when viewed from behind) so that the rotor 
mast has a built-in tilt to oppose the tail rotor thrust. 

• Flight controls can be rigged so that the rotor disk is 
tilted to the right slightly when the cyclic is centered. 
Whichever method is used, the tip-path plane is tilted 
slightly to the left in the hover. 

• If the transmission is mounted so the rotor shaft is 
vertical with respect to the fuselage, the helicopter 
“hangs” left skid low in the hover. The opposite is 
true for rotor systems turning clockwise when viewed 
from above. 

• In forward flight, the tail rotor continues to push to 
the right, and the helicopter makes a small angle with 
the wind when the rotors are level and the slip ball is 
in the middle. This is called inherent sideslip. 

Ground Effect
When hovering near the ground, a phenomenon known 
as ground effect takes place. This effect usually occurs at 
heights between the surface and approximately one rotor 
diameter above the surface. The friction of the ground 
causes the downwash from the rotor to move outwards from 
the helicopter. This changes the relative direction of the 

downwash from a purely vertical motion to a combination 
of vertical and horizontal motion. As the induced airflow 
through the rotor disk is reduced by the surface friction, the 
lift vector increases. This allows a lower rotor blade angle for 
the same amount of lift, which reduces induced drag. Ground 
effect also restricts the generation of blade tip vortices due to 
the downward and outward airflow making a larger portion 
of the blade produce lift. When the helicopter gains altitude 
vertically, with no forward airspeed, induced airflow is no 
longer restricted, and the blade tip vortices increase with 
the decrease in outward airflow. As a result, drag increases 
which means a higher pitch angle, and more power is needed 
to move the air down through the rotor.

Ground effect is at its maximum in a no-wind condition over 
a firm, smooth surface. Tall grass, rough terrain, and water 
surfaces alter the airflow pattern, causing an increase in rotor 
tip vortices. [Figure 2-33]

Coriolis Effect (Law of Conservation of Angular 
Momentum) 
The Coriolis effect is also referred to as the law of 
conservation of angular momentum. It states that the value 
of angular momentum of a rotating body does not change 
unless an external force is applied. In other words, a rotating 
body continues to rotate with the same rotational velocity 
until some external force is applied to change the speed of 
rotation. Angular momentum is moment of inertia (mass 
times distance from the center of rotation squared) multiplied 
by speed of rotation. Changes in angular velocity, known as 
angular acceleration and deceleration, take place as the mass 
of a rotating body is moved closer to or further away from 
the axis of rotation. The speed of the rotating mass increases 
or decreases in proportion to the square of the radius. An 
excellent example of this principle is a spinning ice skater. 
The skater begins rotation on one foot, with the other leg 
and both arms extended. The rotation of the skater’s body is 
relatively slow. When a skater draws both arms and one leg 
inward, the moment of inertia (mass times radius squared) 
becomes much smaller and the body is rotating almost faster 
than the eye can follow. Because the angular momentum 
must remain constant (no external force applied), the angular 
velocity must increase. The rotor blade rotating about the 
rotor hub possesses angular momentum. As the rotor begins 
to cone due to G-loading maneuvers, the diameter or the 
disk shrinks. Due to conservation of angular momentum, 
the blades continue to travel the same speed even though the 
blade tips have a shorter distance to travel due to reduced 
disk diameter. The action results in an increase in rotor rpm. 
Most pilots arrest this increase with an increase in collective 
pitch. Conversely, as G-loading subsides and the rotor disk 
flattens out from the loss of G-load induced coning, the 
blade tips now have a longer distance to travel at the same

tip speed. This action results in a reduction of rotor rpm. 
However, if this drop in the rotor rpm continues to the point 
at which it attempts to decrease below normal operating 
rpm, the engine control system adds more fuel/power to 
maintain the specified engine rpm. If the pilot does not reduce 
collective pitch as the disk unloads, the combination of engine 
compensation for the rpm slow down and the additional pitch 
as G-loading increases may result in exceeding the torque 
limitations or power the engines can produce.

Vertical Flight
Hovering is actually an element of vertical flight. Increasing 
the AOA of the rotor blades (pitch) while keeping their 
rotation speed constant generates additional lift and the 
helicopter ascends. Decreasing the pitch causes the helicopter 

to descend. In a no wind condition, when lift and thrust are 
less than weight and drag, the helicopter descends vertically. 
If lift and thrust are greater than weight and drag, the 
helicopter ascends vertically. [Figure 2-34]

Forward Flight
In steady forward flight with no change in airspeed or vertical 
speed, the four forces of lift, thrust, drag, and weight must 
be in balance. Once the tip-path plane is tilted forward, the 
total lift-thrust force is also tilted forward. This resultant 
lift-thrust force can be resolved into two components—lift 
acting vertically upward and thrust acting horizontally in the 
direction of flight. In addition to lift and thrust, there is weight 
(the downward acting force) and drag (the force opposing the 
motion of an airfoil through the air). [Figure 2-35]

Figure 2-37. The airflow pattern for 1–5 knots of forward airspeed. Note how the downwind vortex is beginning to dissipate and induced 
flow down through the rear of the rotor system is more horizontal. 

Figure 2-36. Changing force vectors results in aircraft movement. 

In straight-and-level (constant heading and at a constant 
altitude), unaccelerated forward flight, lift equals weight 
and thrust equals drag. If lift exceeds weight, the helicopter 
accelerates vertically until the forces are in balance; if thrust 
is less than drag, the helicopter slows until the forces are in 
balance. As the helicopter moves forward, it begins to lose 
altitude because lift is lost as thrust is diverted forward. 
However, as the helicopter begins to accelerate, the rotor 
system becomes more efficient due to the increased airflow. 
The result is excess power over that which is required to 
hover. Continued acceleration causes an even larger increase 
in airflow through the rotor disk and more excess power. In 
order to maintain unaccelerated flight, the pilot must not 
make any changes in power or in cyclic movement. Any 
such changes would cause the helicopter to climb or descend. 
Once straight-and-level flight is obtained, the pilot should 
make note of the power (torque setting) required and not 
make major adjustments to the flight controls. [Figure 2-36]
 
Translational Lift
Improved rotor efficiency resulting from directional flight is 
called translational lift. The efficiency of the hovering rotor 
system is greatly improved with each knot of incoming wind 
gained by horizontal movement of the aircraft or surface 
wind. As incoming wind produced by aircraft movement or 
surface wind enters the rotor system, turbulence and vortices 
are left behind and the flow of air becomes more horizontal. 
In addition, the tail rotor becomes more aerodynamically 
efficient during the transition from hover to forward flight. 
Translational thrust occurs when the tail rotor becomes more 
aerodynamically efficient during the transition from hover 
to forward flight. As the tail rotor works in progressively 
less turbulent air, this improved efficiency produces more 
antitorque thrust, causing the nose of the aircraft to yaw left 
(with a main rotor turning counterclockwise) and forces the 

pilot to apply right pedal (decreasing the AOA in the tail 
rotor blades) in response. In addition, during this period, the 
airflow affects the horizontal components of the stabilizer 
found on most helicopters which tends to bring the nose 
of the helicopter to a more level attitude. Figure 2-37 and 
Figure 2-38 show airflow patterns at different speeds and 
how airflow affects the efficiency of the tail rotor. 

Effective Translational Lift (ETL)
While transitioning to forward flight at about 16–24 knots, 
the helicopter experiences effective translational lift (ETL). 
As mentioned earlier in the discussion on translational lift,

the rotor blades become more efficient as forward airspeed 
increases. Between 16–24 knots, the rotor system completely 
outruns the recirculation of old vortices and begins to work 
in relatively undisturbed air. The flow of air through the 
rotor system is more horizontal, therefore induced flow 
and induced drag are reduced. The AOA is subsequently 
increased, which makes the rotor system operate more 
efficiently. This increased efficiency continues with increased 
airspeed until the best climb airspeed is reached, and total 
drag is at its lowest point. 

As speed increases, translational lift becomes more effective, 
the nose rises or pitches up, and the aircraft rolls to the right. 
The combined effects of dissymmetry of lift, gyroscopic 
precession, and transverse flow effect cause this tendency. It is 
important to understand these effects and anticipate correcting 
for them. Once the helicopter is transitioning through ETL, 
the pilot needs to apply forward and left lateral cyclic input to 
maintain a constant rotor-disk attitude. [Figure 2-39]

Dissymmetry of Lift
Dissymmetry of lift is the differential (unequal) lift between 
advancing and retreating halves of the rotor disk caused by the 
different wind flow velocity across each half. This difference 
in lift would cause the helicopter to be uncontrollable in any 
situation other than hovering in a calm wind. There must 
be a means of compensating, correcting, or eliminating this 
unequal lift to attain symmetry of lift.

When the helicopter moves through the air, the relative airflow 
through the main rotor disk is different on the advancing side 
than on the retreating side. The relative wind encountered 
by the advancing blade is increased by the forward speed 
of the helicopter; while the relative windspeed acting on 
the retreating blade is reduced by the helicopter’s forward 
airspeed. Therefore, as a result of the relative windspeed, the 
advancing blade side of the rotor disk produces more lift than 
the retreating blade side. [Figure 2-40]

If this condition was allowed to exist, a helicopter with a 
counterclockwise main rotor blade rotation would roll to the 
left because of the difference in lift. In reality, the main rotor 
blades flap and feather automatically to equalize lift across 
the rotor disk. Articulated rotor systems, usually with three or 
more blades, incorporate a horizontal hinge (flapping hinge) 
to allow the individual rotor blades to move, or flap up and 
down as they rotate. A semirigid rotor system (two blades) 
utilizes a teetering hinge, which allows the blades to flap as 
a unit. When one blade flaps up, the other blade flaps down.

Figure 2-40. The blade tip speed of this helicopter is approximately 
300 knots. If the helicopter is moving forward at 100 knots, the 
relative windspeed on the advancing side is 400 knots. On the 
retreating side, it is only 200 knots. This difference in speed causes 
a dissymmetry of lift.

As the rotor blade reaches the advancing side of the rotor 
disk, it reaches its maximum upward flapping velocity. 
[Figure 2-41A] When the blade flaps upward, the angle 
between the chord line and the resultant relative wind 

decreases. This decreases the AOA, which reduces the 
amount of lift produced by the blade. At position C, the rotor 
blade is at its maximum downward flapping velocity. Due 
to downward flapping, the angle between the chord line and 
the resultant relative wind increases. This increases the AOA 
and thus the amount of lift produced by the blade.

The combination of blade flapping and slow relative wind 
acting on the retreating blade normally limits the maximum 
forward speed of a helicopter. At a high forward speed, the 
retreating blade stalls due to high AOA and slow relative 
wind speed. This situation is called “retreating blade 
stall” and is evidenced by a nose-up pitch, vibration, and 
a rolling tendency—usually to the left in helicopters with 
counterclockwise blade rotation. Pilots can avoid retreating 
blade stall by not exceeding the never-exceed speed. This 
speed is designated VNE and is indicated on a placard and 
marked on the airspeed indicator by a red line.

During aerodynamic flapping of the rotor blades as they 
compensate for dissymmetry of lift, the advancing blade 
achieves maximum upward flapping displacement over the 
nose and maximum downward flapping displacement over 
the tail. This causes the tip-path plane to tilt to the rear and 
is referred to as blowback. Figure 2-42 shows how the rotor

effect, the blades are “gliding” in their rotational plane.

disk is originally oriented with the front down following 
the initial cyclic input. As airspeed is gained and flapping 
eliminates dissymmetry of lift, the front of the disk comes 
up, and the back of the disk goes down. This reorientation 
of the rotor disk changes the direction in which total rotor 
thrust acts; the helicopter’s forward speed slows, but can be 
corrected with cyclic input. The pilot uses cyclic feathering 
to compensate for dissymmetry of lift allowing him or her 
to control the attitude of the rotor disk.

Cyclic feathering compensates for dissymmetry of lift 
(changes the AOA) in the following way. At a hover, equal 
lift is produced around the rotor system with equal pitch and 
AOA on all the blades and at all points in the rotor system 
(disregarding compensation for translating tendency). The 
rotor disk is parallel to the horizon. To develop a thrust force, 
the rotor system must be tilted in the desired direction of 
movement. Cyclic feathering changes the angle of incidence 
differentially around the rotor system. Forward cyclic 
movements decrease the angle of incidence at one part on 

the rotor system while increasing the angle at another part. 
Maximum downward flapping of the blade over the nose 
and maximum upward flapping over the tail tilt both rotor 
disk and thrust vector forward. To prevent blowback from 
occurring, the pilot must continually move the cyclic forward 
as the velocity of the helicopter increases. Figure 2-42 
illustrates the changes in pitch angle as the cyclic is moved 
forward at increased airspeeds. At a hover, the cyclic is 
centered and the pitch angle on the advancing and retreating 
blades is the same. At low forward speeds, moving the cyclic 
forward reduces pitch angle on the advancing blade and 
increases pitch angle on the retreating blade. This causes 
a slight rotor tilt. At higher forward speeds, the pilot must 
continue to move the cyclic forward. This further reduces 
pitch angle on the advancing blade and further increases 
pitch angle on the retreating blade. As a result, there is even 
more tilt to the rotor than at lower speeds.

This horizontal lift component (thrust) generates higher 
helicopter airspeed. The higher airspeed induces blade 
flapping to maintain symmetry of lift. The combination of 
flapping and cyclic feathering maintains symmetry of lift and 
desired attitude on the rotor system and helicopter.

Autorotation
Autorotation is the state of flight in which the main rotor system 
of a helicopter is being turned by the action of air moving up 
through the rotor rather than engine power driving the rotor. 
[Figure 2-43] In normal, powered flight, air is drawn into the 
main rotor system from above and exhausted downward, but 
during autorotation, air moves up into the rotor system from 
below as the helicopter descends. Autorotation is permitted 
mechanically by a freewheeling unit, which is a special clutch 
mechanism that allows the main rotor to continue turning even 
if the engine is not running. If the engine fails, the freewheeling

unit automatically disengages the engine from the main rotor 
allowing the main rotor to rotate freely. It is the means by 
which a helicopter can be landed safely in the event of an 
engine failure; consequently, all helicopters must demonstrate 
this capability in order to be certificated. 

Rotorcraft Controls
Swash Plate Assembly
The purpose of the swash plate is to transmit control inputs 
from the collective and cyclic controls to the main rotor 
blades. It consists of two main parts: the stationary swash 
plate and the rotating swash plate. [Figure 2-44] 

The stationary swash plate is mounted around the main rotor 
mast and connected to the cyclic and collective controls 
by a series of pushrods. It is restrained from rotating by an 
antidrive link but is able to tilt in all directions and move 
vertically. The rotating swash plate is mounted to the 
stationary swash plate by a uniball sleeve. It is connected to 
the mast by drive links and is allowed to rotate with the main 
rotor mast. Both swash plates tilt and slide up and down as 
one unit. The rotating swash plate is connected to the pitch 
horns by the pitch links.

There are three major controls in a helicopter that the pilot 
must use during flight. They are the collective pitch control, 
cyclic pitch control, and antitorque pedals or tail rotor control. 
In addition to these major controls, the pilot must also use the 

throttle control, which is mounted directly to the collective 
pitch control in order to fly the helicopter. 

Collective Pitch Control
The collective pitch control is located on the left side of the 
pilot’s seat and is operated with the left hand. The collective 
is used to make changes to the pitch angle of all the main 
rotor blades simultaneously, or collectively, as the name 
implies. As the collective pitch control is raised, there is a 
simultaneous and equal increase in pitch angle of all main 
rotor blades; as it is lowered, there is a simultaneous and 
equal decrease in pitch angle. [Figure 2-45] This is done 
through a series of mechanical linkages, and the amount 
of movement in the collective lever determines the amount

prevent inadvertent collective pitch movement.

Throttle Control
The function of the throttle is to regulate engine rpm. If the 
correlator or governor system does not maintain the desired 
rpm when the collective is raised or lowered, or if those 
systems are not installed, the throttle must be moved manually 
with the twist grip to maintain rpm. The throttle control is 
much like a motorcycle throttle, and works almost the same 
way; twisting the throttle to the left increases rpm, twisting 
the throttle to the right decreases rpm. [Figure 2-46]

Governor/Correlator 
A governor is a sensing device that senses rotor and engine rpm 
and makes the necessary adjustments in order to keep rotor rpm 
constant. Once the rotor rpm is set in normal operations, the 
governor keeps the rpm constant, and there is no need to make 
any throttle adjustments. Governors are common on all turbine 
helicopters (as it is a function of the fuel control system of the 
turbine engine), and used on some piston-powered helicopters.

A correlator is a mechanical connection between the 
collective lever and the engine throttle. When the collective 
lever is raised, power is automatically increased and when 
lowered, power is decreased. This system maintains rpm 
close to the desired value, but still requires adjustment of 
the throttle for fine tuning.

Some helicopters do not have correlators or governors and 
require coordination of all collective and throttle movements. 
When the collective is raised, the throttle must be increased; 
when the collective is lowered, the throttle must be decreased. 
As with any aircraft control, large adjustments of either 
collective pitch or throttle should be avoided. All corrections 
should be made with smooth pressure.

In piston helicopters, the collective pitch is the primary 
control for manifold pressure, and the throttle is the primary 
control for rpm. However, the collective pitch control also 
influences rpm, and the throttle also influences manifold 
pressure; therefore, each is considered to be a secondary 
control of the other’s function. Both the tachometer (rpm 
indicator) and the manifold pressure gauge must be analyzed 
to determine which control to use. Figure 2-47 illustrates 
this relationship.

Cyclic Pitch Control
The cyclic pitch control is mounted vertically from the 
cockpit floor, between the pilot’s legs or, in some models, 
between the two pilot seats. [Figure 2-48] This primary flight 
control allows the pilot to fly the helicopter in any horizontal 
direction; fore, aft, and sideways. The total lift force is always 
perpendicular to the tip-path place of the main rotor. The 
purpose of the cyclic pitch control is to tilt the tip-path plane 
in the direction of the desired horizontal direction. The cyclic 
control changes the direction of this force and controls the 
attitude and airspeed of the helicopter. 

The rotor disk tilts in the same direction the cyclic pitch 
control is moved. If the cyclic is moved forward, the rotor 
disk tilts forward; if the cyclic is moved aft, the disk tilts 
aft, and so on. Because the rotor disk acts like a gyro, the 
mechanical linkages for the cyclic control rods are rigged 
in such a way that they decrease the pitch angle of the rotor 
blade approximately 90° before it reaches the direction of 
cyclic displacement, and increase the pitch angle of the 
rotor blade approximately 90° after it passes the direction of 
displacement. An increase in pitch angle increases AOA; a 
decrease in pitch angle decreases AOA. For example, if the 
cyclic is moved forward, the AOA decreases as the rotor blade 
passes the right side of the helicopter and increases on the left 
side. This results in maximum downward deflection of the

rotor blade in front of the helicopter and maximum upward 
deflection behind it, causing the rotor disk to tilt forward.

Antitorque Pedals
The antitorque pedals are located on the cabin floor by the 
pilot’s feet. They control the pitch and, therefore, the thrust of 
the tail rotor blades. [Figure 2-49] Newton’s third law applies 
to the helicopter fuselage and how it rotates in the opposite 
direction of the main rotor blades unless counteracted and 
controlled. To make flight possible and to compensate for this 
torque, most helicopter designs incorporate an antitorque rotor 
or tail rotor. The antitorque pedals allow the pilot to control 
the pitch angle of the tail rotor blades which in forward flight 
puts the helicopter in longitudinal trim and while at a hover, 
enables the pilot to turn the helicopter 360°. The antitorque 
pedals are connected to the pitch change mechanism on the 
tail rotor gearbox and allow the pitch angle on the tail rotor 
blades to be increased or decreased.

Helicopters that are designed with tandem rotors do not have 
an antitorque rotor. These helicopters are designed with both 
rotor systems rotating in opposite directions to counteract the 
torque, rather than using a tail rotor. Directional antitorque 
pedals are used for directional control of the aircraft while in 
flight, as well as while taxiing with the forward gear off the 
ground. With the right pedal displaced forward, the forward 
rotor disk tilts to the right, while the aft rotor disk tilts to 
the left. The opposite occurs when the left pedal is pushed 
forward; the forward rotor disk inclines to the left, and the aft 
rotor disk tilts to the right. Differing combinations of pedal 
and cyclic application can allow the tandem rotor helicopter 
to pivot about the aft or forward vertical axis, as well as 
pivoting about the center of mass.

Stabilizer Systems
Bell Stabilizer Bar System
Arthur M. Young discovered that stability could be increased 
significantly with the addition of a stabilizer bar perpendicular 
to the two blades. The stabilizer bar has weighted ends, which 
cause it to stay relatively stable in the plane of rotation. The 
stabilizer bar is linked with the swash plate in a manner that 
reduces the pitch rate. The two blades can flap as a unit and, 
therefore, do not require lag-lead hinges (the whole rotor slows 
down and accelerates per turn). Two-bladed systems require 
a single teetering hinge and two coning hinges to permit 
modest coning of the rotor disk as thrust is increased. The 
configuration is known under multiple names, including Hiller 
panels, Hiller system, Bell-Hiller system, and flybar system.

Offset Flapping Hinge
The offset flapping hinge is offset from the center of the rotor 
hub and can produce powerful moments useful for controlling 
the helicopter. The distance of the hinge from the hub (the 
offset) multiplied by the force produced at the hinge produces 
a moment at the hub. Obviously, the larger the offset, the 
greater the moment for the same force produced by the blade. 

The flapping motion is the result of the constantly changing 
balance between lift, centrifugal, and inertial forces. This 
rising and falling of the blades is characteristic of most 
helicopters and has often been compared to the beating of 
a bird’s wing. The flapping hinge, together with the natural 
flexibility found in most blades, permits the blade to droop 
considerably when the helicopter is at rest and the rotor is not 
turning over. During flight, the necessary rigidity is provided 
by the powerful centrifugal force that results from the rotation 
of the blades. This force pulls outward from the tip, stiffening 
the blade, and is the only factor that keeps it from folding up.

Stability Augmentation Systems (SAS)
Some helicopters incorporate stability augmentation systems 
(SAS) to help stabilize the helicopter in flight and in a hover. 
The simplest of these systems is a force trim system, which 
uses a magnetic clutch and springs to hold the cyclic control in 
the position at which it was released. More advanced systems 
use electric actuators that make inputs to the hydraulic servos. 
These servos receive control commands from a computer 
that senses helicopter attitude. Other inputs, such as heading, 
speed, altitude, and navigation information may be supplied 
to the computer to form a complete autopilot system. The 
SAS may be overridden or disconnected by the pilot at any 
time. SAS reduces pilot workload by improving basic aircraft 
control harmony and decreasing disturbances. These systems 
are very useful when the pilot is required to perform other 
duties, such as sling loading and search and rescue operations.

Helicopter Vibration
The following paragraphs describe the various types of 
vibrations. Figure 2-50 shows the general levels into which 
frequencies are divided.

Extreme Low Frequency Vibration
Extreme low frequency vibration is pretty well limited to pylon 
rock. Pylon rocking (two to three cycles per second) is inherent 
with the rotor, mast, and transmission system. To keep the 
vibration from reaching noticeable levels, transmission mount 
dampening is incorporated to absorb the rocking. 

Low Frequency Vibration
Low frequency vibrations (1/rev and 2/rev) are caused by the 
rotor itself. 1/rev vibrations are of two basic types: vertical 
or lateral. A 1/rev is caused simply by one blade developing 
more lift at a given point than the other blade develops at 
the same point. 

Medium Frequency Vibration
Medium frequency vibration (4/rev and 6/rev) is another 
vibration inherent in most rotors. An increase in the level of 
these vibrations is caused by a change in the capability of the 
fuselage to absorb vibration, or a loose airframe component, 
such as the skids, vibrating at that frequency. 

High Frequency Vibration
High frequency vibrations can be caused by anything in the 
helicopter that rotates or vibrates at extremely high speeds. 
A high frequency vibration typically occurs when the tail 
rotor gears, tail drive shaft or the tail rotor engine, fan or 
shaft assembly vibrates or rotates at an equal or greater speed 
than the tail rotor.

Rotor Blade Tracking
Blade tracking is the process of determining the positions 
of the tips of the rotor blade relative to each other while the 
rotor head is turning, and of determining the corrections 
necessary to hold these positions within certain tolerances. 
The blades should all track one another as closely as possible. 
The purpose of blade tracking is to bring the tips of all blades 
into the same tip path throughout their entire cycle of rotation. 
Various methods of blade tracking are explained below.

Flag and Pole
The flag and pole method, as shown in Figure 2-51, shows 
the relative positions of the rotor blades. The blade tips are 
marked with chalk or a grease pencil. Each blade tip should 
be marked with a different color so that it is easy to determine 
the relationship of the other tips of the rotor blades to each 
other. This method can be used on all types of helicopters 
that do not have jet propulsion at the blade tips. Refer to 
the applicable maintenance manual for specific procedures.

Electronic Blade Tracker
The most common electronic blade tracker consists of 
a Balancer/Phazor, Strobex tracker, and Vibrex tester. 
[Figures 2-52 through 2-54] The Strobex blade tracker 
permits blade tracking from inside or outside the helicopter 
while on the ground or inside the helicopter in flight. The 
system uses a highly concentrated light beam flashing in 

sequence with the rotation of the main rotor blades so that a 
fixed target at the blade tips appears to be stopped. Each blade 
is identified by an elongated retroreflective number taped or 
attached to the underside of the blade in a uniform location. 
When viewed at an angle from inside the helicopter, the taped 
numbers will appear normal. Tracking can be accomplished 
with tracking tip cap reflectors and a strobe light. The tip

caps are temporarily attached to the tip of each blade. The 
high-intensity strobe light flashes in time with the rotating 
blades. The strobe light operates from the aircraft electrical 
power supply. By observing the reflected tip cap image, it 
is possible to view the track of the rotating blades. Tracking 
is accomplished in a sequence of four separate steps: ground 
tracking, hover verification, forward flight tracking, and 
autorotation rpm adjustment.

Tail Rotor Tracking
The marking and electronic methods of tail rotor tracking 
are explained in the following paragraphs.

Marking Method
Procedures for tail rotor tracking using the marking method, 
as shown in Figure 2-55, are as follows:

• After replacement or installation of tail rotor hub, 
blades, or pitch change system, check tail rotor rigging 
and track tail rotor blades. Tail rotor tip clearance shall 
be set before tracking and checked again after tracking.

• The strobe-type tracking device may be used if 
available. Instructions for use are provided with the 
device. Attach a piece of soft rubber hose six inches 
long on the end of a ½ × ½ inch pine stick or other 
flexible device. Cover the rubber hose with Prussian 
blue or similar type of coloring thinned with oil. 

NOTE: Ground run-up shall be performed by authorized 
personnel only. Start engine in accordance with applicable 

maintenance manual. Run engine with pedals in neutral 
position. Reset marking device on underside of tail boom 
assembly. Slowly move marking device into disk of tail rotor 
approximately one inch from tip. When near blade is marked, 
stop engine and allow rotor to stop. Repeat this procedure 
until tracking mark crosses over to the other blade, then 
extend pitch control link of unmarked blade one half turn. 

Electronic Method
The electronic Vibrex balancing and tracking kit is housed in 
a carrying case and consists of a Model 177M-6A Balancer, 
a Model 135M-11 Strobex, track and balance charts, an 
accelerometer, cables, and attaching brackets. 

The Vibrex balancing kit is used to measure and indicate the 
level of vibration induced by the main rotor and tail rotor of 
a helicopter. The Vibrex analyzes the vibration induced by 
out-of-track or out-of-balance rotors, and then by plotting 
vibration amplitude and clock angle on a chart the amount 
and location of rotor track or weight change is determined. In 
addition, the Vibrex is used in troubleshooting by measuring 
the vibration levels and frequencies or rpm of unknown 
disturbances.

Rotor Blade Preservation and Storage
Accomplish the following requirements for rotor blade 
preservation and storage:

 • Condemn, demilitarize, and dispose of locally any 
blade which has incurred nonrepairable damage. 

• Tape all holes in the blade, such as tree damage, or 
foreign object damage (FOD) to protect the interior 
of the blade from moisture and corrosion. 

• Thoroughly remove foreign matter from the entire 
exterior surface of blade with mild soap and water. 

• Protect blade outboard eroded surfaces with a light 
coating of corrosion preventive or primer coating. 

• Protect blade main bolt hole bushing, drag brace 
retention bolt hole bushing, and any exposed bare 
metal (i.e., grip and drag pads) with a light coating of 
corrosion preventive. 

• Secure blade to shock-mounted support and secure 
container lid. 

• Place copy of manufacturer’s blade records, containing 
information required by Title 14 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (14 CFR) section 91.417(a)(2)(ii), and 
any other blade records in a waterproof bag and insert 
into container record tube. 

• Obliterate old markings from the container that 
pertained to the original shipment or to the original 
item it contained. Annotate the blade model, part 
number (P/N) and serial number, as applicable, on 
the outside of the container.

Helicopter Power Systems
Powerplant
The two most common types of engines used in helicopters 
are the reciprocating engine and the turbine engine. 
Reciprocating engines, also called piston engines, are 
generally used in smaller helicopters. Most training 
helicopters use reciprocating engines because they are 
relatively simple and inexpensive to operate. Turbine 
engines are more powerful and are used in a wide variety of 
helicopters. They produce a tremendous amount of power 
for their size but are generally more expensive to operate.

Reciprocating Engine
The reciprocating engine consists of a series of pistons 
connected to a rotating crankshaft. As the pistons move up 
and down, the crankshaft rotates. The reciprocating engine 
gets its name from the back-and-forth movement of its 
internal parts. The four-stroke engine is the most common 
type, and refers to the four different cycles the engine 
undergoes to produce power. [Figure 2-56]

When the piston moves away from the cylinder head on 
the intake stroke, the intake valve opens and a mixture of 
fuel and air is drawn into the combustion chamber. As the 
cylinder moves back toward the cylinder head, the intake 
valve closes, and the fuel/air mixture is compressed. When 
compression is nearly complete, the spark plugs fire and the 
compressed mixture is ignited to begin the power stroke. 
The rapidly expanding gases from the controlled burning of 
the fuel/air mixture drive the piston away from the cylinder 
head, thus providing power to rotate the crankshaft. The 
piston then moves back toward the cylinder head on the 
exhaust stroke where the burned gases are expelled through 
the opened exhaust valve. Even when the engine is operated 
at a fairly low speed, the four-stroke cycle takes place several 
hundred times each minute. In a four-cylinder engine, each 
cylinder operates on a different stroke. Continuous rotation 
of a crankshaft is maintained by the precise timing of the 
power strokes in each cylinder.

Figure 2-57. Many helicopters use a turboshaft engine as shown above to drive the main transmission and rotor systems. The main 
difference between a turboshaft and a turbojet engine is that most of the energy produced by the expanding gases is used to drive a 
turbine rather than producing thrust through the expulsion of exhaust gases. 

Turbine Engine
The gas turbine engine mounted on most helicopters is 
made up of a compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, 
and accessory gearbox assembly. The compressor draws 
filtered air into the plenum chamber and compresses it. The 
compressed air is directed to the combustion section through 
discharge tubes where atomized fuel is injected into it. The 
fuel/air mixture is ignited and allowed to expand. This 
combustion gas is then forced through a series of turbine 
wheels causing them to turn. These turbine wheels provide 
power to both the engine compressor and the accessory 
gearbox. Power is provided to the main rotor and tail rotor 
systems through the freewheeling unit which is attached 
to the accessory gearbox power output gear shaft. The 
combustion gas is finally expelled through an exhaust outlet. 
[Figure 2-57]

Transmission System
The transmission system transfers power from the engine to 
the main rotor, tail rotor, and other accessories during normal 
flight conditions. The main components of the transmission 
system are the main rotor transmission, tail rotor drive 
system, clutch, and freewheeling unit. The freewheeling unit, 
or autorotative clutch, allows the main rotor transmission to 
drive the tail rotor drive shaft during autorotation. Helicopter 
transmissions are normally lubricated and cooled with their 
own oil supply. A sight gauge is provided to check the 
oil level. Some transmissions have chip detectors located 
in the sump. These detectors are wired to warning lights 
located on the pilot’s instrument panel that illuminate in the 
event of an internal problem. The chip detectors on modern 

helicopters have a “burn off” capability and attempt to correct 
the situation without pilot action. If the problem cannot be 
corrected on its own, the pilot must refer to the emergency 
procedures for that particular helicopter. 

Main Rotor Transmission
The primary purpose of the main rotor transmission is 
to reduce engine output rpm to optimum rotor rpm. This 
reduction is different for the various helicopters. As an 
example, suppose the engine rpm of a specific helicopter 
is 2,700. A rotor speed of 450 rpm would require a 6:1 
reduction. A 9:1 reduction would mean the rotor would turn 
at 300 rpm. Most helicopters use a dual-needle tachometer 
or a vertical scale instrument to show both engine and rotor 
rpm or a percentage of engine and rotor rpm. The rotor rpm 
indicator normally is used only during clutch engagement to 
monitor rotor acceleration, and in autorotation to maintain 
rpm within prescribed limits. [Figure 2-58]

In helicopters with horizontally mounted engines, another 
purpose of the main rotor transmission is to change the axis of 
rotation from the horizontal axis of the engine to the vertical 
axis of the rotor shaft. [Figure 2-59]

Clutch
In a conventional airplane, the engine and propeller are 
directly connected. However, in a helicopter there is a 
different relationship between the engine and the rotor. 
Because of the greater weight of a rotor in relation to the 
power of the engine, as compared to the weight of a propeller 
and the power in an airplane, the rotor must be disconnected

however, when the needles are superimposed, or married, the ratio 
of the engine rpm is the same as the gear reduction ratio. 

from the engine when the starter is engaged. A clutch allows 
the engine to be started and then gradually pick up the load 
of the rotor.

On free turbine engines, no clutch is required, as the gas 
producer turbine is essentially disconnected from the power 
turbine. When the engine is started, there is little resistance 

from the power turbine. This enables the gas producer turbine 
to accelerate to normal idle speed without the load of the 
transmission and rotor system dragging it down. As the gas 
pressure increases through the power turbine, the rotor blades 
begin to turn, slowly at first and then gradually accelerate to 
normal operating rpm.

On reciprocating helicopters, the two main types of clutches 
are the centrifugal clutch and the belt drive clutch.

Centrifugal Clutch
The centrifugal clutch is made up of an inner assembly and 
an outer drum. The inner assembly, which is connected to 
the engine driveshaft, consists of shoes lined with material 
similar to automotive brake linings. At low engine speeds, 
springs hold the shoes in, so there is no contact with the outer 
drum, which is attached to the transmission input shaft. As 
engine speed increases, centrifugal force causes the clutch 
shoes to move outward and begin sliding against the outer 
drum. The transmission input shaft begins to rotate, causing 
the rotor to turn, slowly at first, but increasing as the friction 
increases between the clutch shoes and transmission drum. 
As rotor speed increases, the rotor tachometer needle shows 
an increase by moving toward the engine tachometer needle. 
When the two needles are superimposed, the engine and the 
rotor are synchronized, indicating the clutch is fully engaged 
and there is no further slippage of the clutch shoes.

Belt Drive Clutch
Some helicopters utilize a belt drive to transmit power from 
the engine to the transmission. A belt drive consists of a 
lower pulley attached to the engine, an upper pulley attached 
to the transmission input shaft, a belt or a series of V-belts, 
and some means of applying tension to the belts. The belts 
fit loosely over the upper and lower pulley when there is 
no tension on the belts. This allows the engine to be started 
without any load from the transmission. Once the engine is 
running, tension on the belts is gradually increased. When the 
rotor and engine tachometer needles are superimposed, the 
rotor and the engine are synchronized, and the clutch is then 
fully engaged. Advantages of this system include vibration 
isolation, simple maintenance, and the ability to start and 
warm up the engine without engaging the rotor.

Freewheeling Unit
Since lift in a helicopter is provided by rotating airfoils, 
these airfoils must be free to rotate if the engine fails. The 
freewheeling unit automatically disengages the engine from 
the main rotor when engine rpm is less than main rotor rpm. 
This allows the main rotor and tail rotor to continue turning 
at normal in-flight speeds. The most common freewheeling 
unit assembly consists of a one-way sprag clutch located 
between the engine and main rotor transmission. This is

usually in the upper pulley in a piston helicopter or mounted 
on the accessory gearbox in a turbine helicopter. When the 
engine is driving the rotor, inclined surfaces in the sprag 
clutch force rollers against an outer drum. This prevents the 
engine from exceeding transmission rpm. If the engine fails, 
the rollers move inward, allowing the outer drum to exceed 
the speed of the inner portion. The transmission can then 
exceed the speed of the engine. In this condition, engine 
speed is less than that of the drive system, and the helicopter 
is in an autorotative state.

Airplane Assembly and Rigging
The primary assembly of a type certificated aircraft is normally 
performed by the manufacturer at the factory. The assembly 
includes putting together the major components, such as 
the fuselage, empennage, wing sections, nacelles, landing 
gear, and installing the powerplant. Attached to the wing 
and empennage are primary flight control surfaces including 
ailerons, elevators, and rudder. Additionally, installation 
of auxiliary flight control surfaces may include wing flaps, 
spoilers, speed brakes, slats, and leading edge flaps. 

The assembly of other aircraft outside of a manufacturer’s 
facility is usually limited to smaller size and experimental 
amateur-built aircraft. Typically, after a major overhaul, 
repair, or alteration, the reassembly of an aircraft may 
include reattaching wings to the fuselage, balancing of and 
installation of flight control surfaces, installation of the 
landing gear, and installation of the powerplant(s). 

Rebalancing of Control Surfaces
This section is presented for familiarization purposes only. 
Explicit instructions for the balancing of control surfaces are 
given in the manufacturer’s service and overhaul manuals for 
the specific aircraft and must be followed closely. 

Any time repairs on a control surface add weight fore or aft of 
the hinge center line, the control surface must be rebalanced. 
When an aircraft is repainted, the balance of the control 
surfaces must be checked. Any control surface that is out 
of balance is unstable and does not remain in a streamlined 
position during normal flight. For example, an aileron that 
is trailing edge heavy moves down when the wing deflects 
upward, and up when the wing deflects downward. Such a 
condition can cause unexpected and violent maneuvers of 
the aircraft. In extreme cases, fluttering and buffeting may 
develop to a degree that could cause the complete loss of 
the aircraft. 

Rebalancing a control surface concerns both static and 
dynamic balance. A control surface that is statically balanced 
is also dynamically balanced. 

Static Balance
Static balance is the tendency of an object to remain stationary 
when supported from its own CG. There are two ways in 
which a control surface may be out of static balance. They 
are called underbalance and overbalance. 

When a control surface is mounted on a balance stand, a 
downward travel of the trailing edge below the horizontal 
position indicates underbalance. Some manufacturers 
indicate this condition with a plus (+) sign. An upward 
movement of the trailing edge, above the horizontal position 
indicates overbalance. This is designated by a minus (–) sign. 
These signs show the need for more or less weight in the 
correct area to achieve a balanced control surface, as shown 
in Figure 2-60.

A tail-heavy condition (static underbalance) causes 
undesirable flight performance and is not usually allowed. 
Better flight operations are gained by nose-heavy static 
overbalance. Most manufacturers advocate the existence of 
nose-heavy control surfaces.

Dynamic Balance
Dynamic balance is that condition in a rotating body wherein 
all rotating forces are balanced within themselves so that no 
vibration is produced while the body is in motion. Dynamic 
balance as related to control surfaces is an effort to maintain 
balance when the control surface is submitted to movement 
on the aircraft in flight. It involves the placing of weights 
in the correct location along the span of the surfaces. The 
location of the weights are, in most cases, forward of the 
hinge center line. 

Rebalancing Procedures 
Repairs to a control surface or its tabs generally increase the 
weight aft of the hinge center line, requiring static rebalancing 
of the control surface system, as well as the tabs. Control 
surfaces to be rebalanced should be removed from the aircraft 
and supported, from their own points, on a suitable stand, 
jig, or fixture. [Figure 2-61] 

Trim tabs on the surface should be secured in the neutral 
position when the control surface is mounted on the stand. 
The stand must be level and be located in an area free of air 
currents. The control surface must be permitted to rotate 
freely about the hinge points without binding. Balance 
condition is determined by the behavior of the trailing edge 
when the surface is suspended from its hinge points. Any 
excessive friction would result in a false reaction as to the 
overbalance or underbalance of the surface. 

When installing the control surface in the stand or jig, a 
neutral position should be established with the chord line of 
the surface in a horizontal position. Use a bubble protractor 
to determine the neutral position before continuing balancing 
procedures. [Figure 2-62] 

Sometimes a visual check is all that is needed to determine 
whether the surface is balanced or unbalanced. Any trim tabs 
or other assemblies that are to remain on the surface during 
balancing procedures should be in place. If any assemblies 
or parts must be removed before balancing, they should be 
removed. 

Rebalancing Methods
Several methods of balancing (rebalancing) control surfaces 
are in use by the various manufacturers of aircraft. The most 
common are the calculation method, scale method, and the 
balance beam method. 

The calculation method of balancing a control surface has one 
advantage over the other methods in that it can be performed 
without removing the surface from the aircraft. In using the 
calculation method, the weight of the material from the repair 
area and the weight of the materials used to accomplish the 
repair must be known. Subtract the weight removed from 
the weight added to get the resulting net gain in the amount 
added to the surface. The distance from the hinge center line 
to the center of the repair area is then measured in inches. This

distance must be determined to the nearest one-hundredth of 
an inch. [Figure 2-63] 

The next step is to multiply the distance times the net weight 
of the repair. This results in an inch-pounds (in-lb) answer. 
If the in-lb result of the calculations is within specified 
tolerances, the control surface is considered balanced. If 
it is not within specified limits, consult the manufacturer’s 
service manuals for the needed weights, material to use for 
weights, design for manufacture, and installation locations 
for addition of the weights.

The scale method of balancing a control surface requires the 
use of a scale that is graduated in hundredths of a pound. 
A support stand and balancing jigs for the surface are also 
required. Figure 2-64 illustrates a control surface mounted 
for rebalancing purposes. Use of the scale method requires 
the removal of the control surface from the aircraft.

The balance beam method is used by the Cessna and Piper 
Aircraft companies. This method requires that a specialized 
tool be locally fabricated. The manufacturer’s maintenance 
manual provides specific instructions and dimensions to 
fabricate the tool.

Once the control surface is placed on level supports, the 
weight required to balance the surface is established by 
moving the sliding weight on the beam. The maintenance 
manual indicates where the balance point should be. If the 
surface is found to be out of tolerance, the manual explains 
where to place weight to bring it into tolerance.

Aircraft manufacturers use different materials to balance 
control surfaces, the most common being lead or steel. 
Larger aircraft manufacturers may use depleted uranium 
because it has a heavier mass than lead. This allows the 
counterweights to be made smaller and still retain the same 
weight. Specific safety precautions must be observed when 
handling counterweights of depleted uranium because it is 
radioactive. The manufacturer’s maintenance manual and 
service instructions must be followed and all precautions 
observed when handling the weights. 

Aircraft Rigging
Aircraft rigging involves the adjustment and travel of movable 
flight controls which are attached to aircraft major surfaces, 
such as wings and vertical and horizontal stabilizers. Ailerons 
are attached to the wings, elevators are attached to the 
horizontal stabilizer, and the rudder is attached to the vertical 
stabilizer. Rigging involves setting cable tension, adjusting 
travel limits of flight controls, and setting travel stops. 

In addition to the flight controls, rigging is also performed 
on various components to include engine controls, flight 
deck controls, and retractable landing gear component parts. 
Rigging also includes the safetying of the attaching hardware 
using various types of cotter pins, locknuts, or safety wire. 

Rigging Specifications
Type Certificate Data Sheet
The Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) is a formal 
description of an aircraft, engine, or propeller. It is issued by 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) when the FAA 
determines that the product meets the applicable requirements 
for certification under 14 CFR. It lists the limitations and 
information required for type certification, including airspeed 
limits, weight limits, control surface movements, engine 
make and model, minimum crew, fuel type, thrust limits, 
rpm limits, etc., and the various components eligible for 
installation on the product.

the applicable product and provides the recommended and 
acceptable procedures to be followed when maintaining or 
repairing that product. Maintenance personnel are required 
by regulation to follow the applicable instructions set forth 
by the manufacturer. The Limitations section of the manual 
lists “life limits” of the product or its components that must 
be complied with during inspections and maintenance. 

Structural Repair Manual (SRM)
The structural repair manual is developed by the manufacturer’s 
engineering department to be used as a guideline to assist in 
the repair of common damage to a specific aircraft structure. 
It provides information for acceptable repairs of specific 
sections of the aircraft.

Manufacturer’s Service Information
Information from the manufacturer may be in the form of 
information bulletins, service instructions, service bulletins, 
service letters, etc., that the manufacturer publishes to provide 
instructions for product improvement. Service instructions may 
include a recommended modification or repair that precedes the 
issuance of an Airworthiness Directive (AD). Service letters 
may provide more descriptive procedures or revise sections of 
the maintenance manuals. They may also include instructions 
for the installation and repair of optional equipment, not listed 
in the Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS).

Airplane Assembly 
Aileron Installation 
The manufacturer’s maintenance and illustrated parts 
book must be followed to ensure the correct procedures 
and hardware are being used for installation of the control 
surfaces. All of the control surfaces require specific hardware, 
spacers, and bearings be installed to ensure the surface does 
not jam or become damaged during movement. After the 
aileron is connected to the flight deck controls, the control 
system must be inspected to ensure the cables/push-pull rods 
are routed properly. When a balance cable is installed, check 
for correct attachment and operation to determine the ailerons 
are moving in the proper direction and opposite each other.
 
Flap Installation
The design, installation, and systems that operate flaps are as 
varied as the models of airplanes on which they are installed. 
As with any system on a specific aircraft, the manufacturer’s 
maintenance manual and the illustrated parts book must 
be followed to ensure the correct procedures and parts are 
used. Simple flap systems are usually operated manually by 
cables and/or torque tubes. Typically, many of the smaller 
manufactured airplane designs have flaps that are actuated 

by torque tubes and chains through a gear box driven by an 
electric motor.

Empennage Installation
The empennage, consisting of the horizontal and vertical 
stabilizer, is not normally removed and installed, unless the 
aircraft was damaged. Elevators, rudders, and stabilators 
are rigged the same as any other control surface, using the 
instructions provided in the manufacturer’s maintenance 
manuals.

Control Operating Systems
Cable Systems
There are various types of cable:

• Material—aircraft control cables are fabricated from 
carbon steel or stainless (corrosion resistant) steel. 
Additionally, some manufacturers use a nylon coated 
cable that is produced by extruding a flexible nylon 
coating over corrosion-resistant steel (CRES) cable. 
By adding the nylon coating to the corrosion resistant 
steel cable, it increases the service life by protecting 
the cable strands from friction wear, keeping dirt and 
grit out, and dampening vibration which can work-
harden the wires in long runs of cable.

• Cable construction—the basic component of a cable 
is a wire. The diameter of the wire determines the 
total diameter of the cable. A number of wires are 
preformed into a helical or spiral shape and then 
formed into a strand. These preformed strands are laid 
around a straight center strand to form a cable. 

• Cable designations—based on the number of strands 
and wires in each strand. The 7 × 19 cable is made up 
of seven strands of 19 wires each. Six of these strands 
are laid around the center strand. This cable is very 
flexible and is used in primary control systems and 
in other locations where operation over pulleys is 
frequent. The 7 × 7 cable consists of seven strands of 
seven wires each. Six of these strands are laid around 
the center strand. This cable is of medium flexibility 
and is used for trim tab controls, engine controls, and 
indicator controls. [Figure 2-65]

Types of control cable termination include:

• Woven splice—a hand-woven 5-tuck splice used on 
aircraft cable. The process is very time consuming and 
produces only about 75 percent of the original cable 
strength. The splice is rarely used except on some 
antique aircraft where the effort is made to keep all 
parts in their original configuration.

• Nicopress® process—a patented process using copper 
sleeves and may be used up to the full rated strength of 
the cable when the cable is looped around a thimble. 
[Figure 2-66] This process may also be used in place 
of the 5-tuck splice on cables up to and including 3⁄8-
inch diameter. Whenever this process is used for cable 
splicing, it is imperative that the tools, instructions, 
and data supplied by Nicopress® be followed exactly 
to ensure the desired cable function and strength 
is attained. The use of sleeves that are fabricated 
of material other than copper requires engineering 
approval for the specific application by the FAA.

• Swage-type terminals—manufactured in accordance 
with Army-Navy (AN) and Military Standards (MS), 
are suitable for use in civil aircraft up to, and including, 
maximum cable loads. [Figure 2-67] 

When swaging tools are used, it is imperative that all the 
manufacturer’s instructions, including ‘go’ and ‘no-go’ 
dimensions, be followed exactly to avoid defective and 
inferior swaging. Compliance with all of the instructions 
should result in the terminal developing the full-rated strength 
of the cable. The following basic procedures are used when 
swaging terminals onto cable ends:

• Cut the cable to length, allowing for growth during 
swaging. Apply a preservative compound to the cable 
end before insertion into the terminal barrel. Measure 
the internal length of the terminal end/barrel of the 
fitting to determine the proper length of the cable to 

be inserted. Transfer that measurement to the end of 
the cable and mark it with a piece of masking tape 
wrapped around the cable. This provides a positive 
mark to ensure the cable did not slip during the 
swaging process. 

 NOTE: Never solder the cable ends to prevent fraying 
since the solder greatly increases the tendency of the 
cable to pull out of the terminal. 

• Insert the cable into the terminal approximately one 
inch and bend it toward the terminal. Then, push the 
cable end all the way into the terminal. The bending 
action puts a slight kink in the cable end and provides 
enough friction to hold the terminal in place until the 
swaging operation is performed. [Figure 2-68] 

• Accomplish the swaging operation in accordance with 
the instructions furnished by the manufacturer of the 
swaging equipment.

• Inspect the terminal after swaging to determine that it 
is free of die marks and splits and is not out of round. 
Check the cable for slippage at the masking tape and 
for cut and broken wire strands.

• Using a go/no-go gauge supplied by the swaging 
tool manufacturer or a micrometer and swaging 
chart, check the terminal shank diameter for proper 
dimension. [Figures 2-69 and 2-70]

• Test the cable by proof-loading locally fabricated 
splices and newly installed swage terminal cable 
fittings for proper strength before installation. This 
is conducted by slowly applying a test load equal to 
60 percent of the rated breaking strength of the cable 
listed in Figure 2-71.

This load should be held for at least 3 minutes. Any testing 
of this type can be dangerous. Suitable guards should be 
placed over the cable during the test to prevent injury to 

personnel in the event of cable failure. If a proper test fixture 
is not available, the load test should be contracted out and 
performed by a properly equipped facility.

Cable Inspection
Aircraft cable systems are subject to a variety of environmental 
conditions and deterioration. Wire or strand breakage is easy 
to recognize visually. Other kinds of deterioration, such as 
wear, corrosion, and distortion, are not easily seen. Special 
attention should be given to areas where cables pass through 
battery compartments, lavatories, and wheel wells. These are 
prime areas for corrosion. Special attention should be given to 
critical fatigue areas. Those areas are defined as anywhere the 
cable runs over, under, or around a pulley, sleeve, or through 
a fairlead; or any section where the cable is flexed, rubbed, 
or within 1 foot of a swaged-on fitting. Close inspection in 
these critical fatigue areas can be performed by rubbing a rag 
along the cable. If there are any broken strands, the rag snags 
on the cable. A more detailed inspection can be performed 
in areas that may be corroded or indicate a fatigue failure by 
loosing or removing the cable and bending it. This technique

Cable System Installation
Cable Guides

Pulleys are used to guide cables and also to change the direction 
of cable movement. Pulley bearings are sealed and need no 
lubrication other than the lubrication done at the factory. 
Brackets fastened to the structure of the aircraft support the 
pulleys. Cables passing over pulleys are kept in place by  
guards. The guards are close fitting to prevent jamming or 
to prevent the cables from slipping off when they slacken 
due to temperature variations. Pulleys should be examined to 
ensure proper lubrication; smooth rotation and freedom from 
abnormal cable wear patterns which can provide an indication 
of other problems in the cable system. [Figure 2-73]

Figure 2-73. Pulley wear patterns. 

Fairleads may be made from a nonmetallic material, such as 
phenolic, or a metallic material, such as soft aluminum. The 
fairlead completely encircles the cable where it passes through 
holes in bulkheads or other metal parts. Fairleads are used to 
guide cables in a straight line through or between structural 
members of the aircraft. Fairleads should never deflect the 
alignment of a cable more than 3° from a straight line.

Pressure seals are installed where cables (or rods) move 
through pressure bulkheads. The seal grips tightly enough 

to prevent excess air pressure loss but not enough to hinder 
movement of the cable. Pressure seals should be inspected 
at regular intervals to determine that the retaining rings are 
in place. If a retaining ring comes off, it may slide along the 
cable and cause jamming of a pulley. [Figure 2-74]

Travel Adjustment

Control surfaces should move a certain distance in either 
direction from the neutral position. These movements must 
be synchronized with the movement of the flight deck 
controls. The flight control system must be adjusted (rigged) 
to obtain these requirements. The tools for measuring surface 
travel primarily include protractors, rigging fixtures, contour 
templates, and rulers. These tools are used when rigging 
flight control systems to assure that the desired travel has 
been obtained. Generally speaking, the rigging consists of 
the following:

1. Positioning the flight control system in neutral and 
temporarily locking it there with rig pins or blocks;

2. Adjusting system cable tension and maintaining 
rudder, elevator, and ailerons in the neutral position; 
and

3. Adjusting the control stops to the aircraft manufacturer’s 
specifications.

Cable Tension

For the aircraft to operate as it was designed, the cable tension 
for the flight controls must be correct. To determine the 
amount of tension on a cable, a tensiometer is used. When 
properly maintained, a tensiometer is 98 percent accurate. 
Cable tension is determined by measuring the amount of force 
needed to make an offset in the cable between two hardened 
steel blocks called anvils. A riser or plunger is pressed against 
the cable to form the offset. Several manufacturers make 
a variety of tensiometers, each type designed for different 
kinds of cable, cable sizes, and cable tensions. [Figure 2-75]

Rigging Fixtures

Rigging fixtures and templates are special tools (gauges) 
designed by the manufacturer to measure control surface 
travel. Markings on the fixture or template indicate desired 
control surface travel.

Tension Regulators

Cable tension regulators are used in some flight control 
systems because there is considerable difference in 
temperature expansion of the aluminum aircraft structure 
and the steel control cables. Some large aircraft incorporate 
tension regulators in the control cable systems to maintain 
a given cable tension automatically. The unit consists of a 
compression spring and a locking mechanism that allows the 
spring to make correction in the system only when the cable 
system is in neutral.

Turnbuckles

A turnbuckle assembly is a mechanical screw device 
consisting of two threaded terminals and a threaded barrel. 
[Figure 2-76] Turnbuckles are fitted in the cable assembly 
for the purpose of making minor adjustments in cable length 
and for adjusting cable tension. One of the terminals has 
right-hand threads, and the other has left-hand threads. The 
barrel has matching right- and left-hand internal threads. The 
end of the barrel with the left-hand threads can usually be 
identified by a groove or knurl around that end of the barrel. 
When installing a turnbuckle in a control system, it is 

necessary to screw both of the terminals an equal number of 
turns into the barrel. It is also essential that all turnbuckle 
terminals be screwed into the barrel until not more than three 
threads are exposed on either side of the turnbuckle barrel. 
After a turnbuckle is properly adjusted, it must be safetied. 
There are a number of methods to safety a turnbuckle and/
or other types of swaged cable ends that are satisfactory. A 
double-wrap safety wire method is preferred.

Some turnbuckles are manufactured and designed to 
accommodate special locking devices. A typical unit is shown 
in Figure 2-77.

Cable Connectors

In addition to turnbuckles, cable connectors are used in some 
systems. These connectors enable a cable length to be quickly 
connected or disconnected from a system. Figure 2-78 
illustrates one type of cable connector in use.

Spring-Back

With a control cable properly rigged, the flight control should 
hit its stops at both extremes prior to the flight deck control.

The spring-back is the small extra push that is needed for the 
flight deck control to hit its mechanical stop. 

Push Rods (Control Rods)
Push rods are used as links in the flight control system to 
give push-pull motion. They may be adjusted at one or both 

ends. Figure 2-79 shows the parts of a push rod. Notice that 
it consists of a tube with threaded rod ends. An adjustable 
antifriction rod end, or rod end clevis, attaches at each end 
of the tube. The rod end, or clevis, permits attachment of 
the tube to flight control system parts. The checknut, when 
tightened, prevents the rod end or clevis from loosening. 
They may have adjustments at one or both ends.

The rods should be perfectly straight, unless designed to be 
otherwise. When installed as part of a control system, the assembly 
should be checked for correct alignment and free movement. 
It is possible for control rods fitted with bearings to become 
disconnected because of failure of the peening that retains the  
ball races in the rod end. This can be avoided by installing 
the control rods so that the flange of the rod end is interposed 
between the ball race and the anchored end of the attaching 
pin or bolt as shown in Figure 2-80.

Another alternative is to place a washer, having a larger 
diameter than the hole in the flange, under the retaining nut 
on the end of the attaching pin or bolt. This retains the rod 
on the bolt in the event of a bearing failure.
 
Torque Tubes
Where an angular or twisting motion is needed in a control 
system, a torque tube is installed. Figure 2-81 shows how a 
torque tube is used to transmit motion in opposite directions. 

Cable Drums
Cable drums are used primarily in trim tab systems. As the trim 
tab control wheel is moved clockwise or counterclockwise, the 

cable drum winds or unwinds to actuate the trim tab cables.

Rigging Checks
All aircraft assembly and rigging must be performed in 
accordance with the requirements prescribed by the specific 
aircraft and/or aircraft component manufacturer. Correctly 
following the procedures provides for proper operation 
of the components in regard to their mechanical and 
aerodynamic function and ensures the structural integrity 
of the aircraft. Rigging procedures are detailed in the 
applicable manufacturer’s maintenance or service manuals 
and applicable structural repair manuals. Additionally,  
aircraft specification or TCDS also provide information 
regarding control surface movement and weight and balance 
limits. 

The purpose of this section is to explain the methods of 
checking the relative alignment and adjustment of an aircraft’s 
main structural components. It is not intended to imply that the 
procedures are exactly as they may be in a particular aircraft. 
When rigging an aircraft, always follow the procedures and 
methods specified by the aircraft manufacturer. 

Structural Alignment
The position or angle of the main structural components is 
related to a longitudinal datum line parallel to the aircraft 
center line and a lateral datum line parallel to a line joining 
the wing tips. Before checking the position or angle of the 
main components, the aircraft must be jacked and leveled. 

Small aircraft usually have fixed pegs or blocks attached to 
the fuselage parallel to or coincident with the datum lines. 
A spirit level and a straight edge are rested across the pegs 
or blocks to check the level of the aircraft. This method of 
checking aircraft level also applies to many of the larger types 
of aircraft. However, the grid method is sometimes used on 
large aircraft. The grid plate is a permanent fixture installed 
on the aircraft floor or supporting structure. [Figure 2-83] 

When the aircraft is to be leveled, a plumb bob is suspended 
from a predetermined position in the ceiling of the aircraft 
over the grid plate. The adjustments to the jacks necessary to 
level the aircraft are indicated on the grid scale. The aircraft 
is level when the plumb bob is suspended over the center 
point of the grid. 

Certain precautions must be observed in all instances when 
jacking an aircraft. Normally, rigging and alignment checks 
should be performed in an enclosed hangar. If this cannot 
be accomplished, the aircraft should be positioned with the 
nose into the wind. 

The weight and loading of the aircraft should be exactly as 
described in the manufacturer’s manual. In all cases, the 
aircraft should not be jacked until it is determined that the 

maximum jacking weight (if applicable) specified by the 
manufacturer is not exceeded. 

With a few exceptions, the dihedral and incidence angles 
of conventional modern aircraft cannot be adjusted. Some 
manufacturers permit adjusting the wing angle of incidence 
to correct for a wing-heavy condition. The dihedral and 
incidence angles should be checked after hard landings or 
after experiencing abnormal flight loads to ensure that the 
components are not distorted and that the angles are within 
the specified limits. 

There are several methods for checking structural alignment 
and rigging angles. Special rigging boards that incorporate, 
or on which can be placed, a special instrument (spirit level 
or inclinometer) for determining the angle are used on some 
aircraft. On a number of aircraft, the alignment is checked 
using a transit and plumb bobs or a theodolite and sighting 
rods. The particular equipment to use is usually specified in 
the manufacturer’s maintenance manual. 

When checking alignment, a suitable sequence should be 
developed and followed to be certain that the checks are 
made at all the positions specified. The alignment checks 
specified usually include: 

• Wing dihedral angle

• Wing incidence angle

• Verticality of the fin

• Engine alignment

• A symmetry check

• Horizontal stabilizer incidence

• Horizontal stabilizer dihedral

Checking Dihedral

The dihedral angle should be checked in the specified 
positions using the special boards provided by the aircraft 
manufacturer. If no such boards are available, a straight edge 
and a inclinometer can be used. The methods for checking 
dihedral are shown in Figure 2-84. 

It is important that the dihedral be checked at the positions 
specified by the manufacturer. Certain portions of the wings 
or horizontal stabilizer may sometimes be horizontal or, on 
rare occasions, anhedral angles may be present. 

Checking Incidence

Incidence is usually checked in at least two specified 
positions on the surface of the wing to ensure that the wing 
is free from twist. A variety of incidence boards are used to 
check the incidence angle. Some have stops at the forward

edge, which must be placed in contact with the leading edge 
of the wing. Others are equipped with location pegs which 
fit into some specified part of the structure. The purpose in 
either case is to ensure that the board is fitted in exactly the 
position intended. In most instances, the boards are kept clear 
of the wing contour by short extensions attached to the board. 
A typical incidence board is shown in Figure 2-85. 

When used, the board is placed at the specified locations on 
the surface being checked. If the incidence angle is correct, 
a inclinometer on top of the board reads zero, or within a 
specified tolerance of zero. Modifications to the areas where 
incidence boards are located can affect the reading. For  
example, if leading edge deicer boots have been installed, 
the position of a board having a leading edge stop is affected.

Checking Fin Verticality

After the rigging of the horizontal stabilizer has been checked, 
the verticality of the vertical stabilizer relative to the lateral 
datum can be checked. The measurements are taken from a 

given point on either side of the top of the fin to a given point 
on the left and right horizontal stabilizers. [Figure 2-86] The 
measurements should be similar within prescribed limits. 
When it is necessary to check the alignment of the rudder 
hinges, remove the rudder and pass a plumb bob line through 
the rudder hinge attachment holes. The line should pass 
centrally through all the holes. It should be noted that some 
aircraft have the leading edge of the vertical fin offset to the 
longitudinal center line to counteract engine torque. 

Checking Engine Alignment

Engines are usually mounted with the thrust line parallel to 
the horizontal longitudinal plane of symmetry. However, this 
is not always true when the engines are mounted on the wings. 
Checking to ensure that the position of the engines, including 
any degree of offset is correct, depends largely on the type of 
mounting. Generally, the check entails a measurement from 
the center line of the mounting to the longitudinal center 
line of the fuselage at the point specified in the applicable 
manual. [Figure 2-87]

Symmetry Check

The principle of a typical symmetry check is illustrated in 
Figure 2-87. The precise figures, tolerances, and checkpoints 
for a particular aircraft are found in the applicable service or 
maintenance manual. 

On small aircraft, the measurements between points are usually 
taken using a steel tape. When measuring long distances, it is 
suggested that a spring scale be used with the tape to obtain 
equal tension. A five-pound pull is usually sufficient. 

On large aircraft, the positions at which the dimensions are 
to be taken are usually chalked on the floor. This is done by 
suspending a plumb bob from the checkpoints and marking 
the floor immediately under the point of each plumb bob. 
The measurements are then taken between the centers of 
each marking.

Cable Tension
When it has been determined that the aircraft is symmetrical 
and structural alignment is within specifications, the cable 
tension and control surface travel can be checked. To 
determine the amount of tension on a cable, a tensiometer 
is used. When properly maintained, a tensiometer is 98 
percent accurate. Cable tension is determined by measuring 
the amount of force needed to make an offset in the cable 
between two hardened steel blocks called anvils. A riser or 
plunger is pressed against the cable to form the offset. Several 
manufacturers make a variety of tensiometers, each type 
designed for different kinds of cable, cable sizes, and cable 
tensions. One type of tensiometer is illustrated in Figure 2-88.

Design limit rig load

Figure 2-89. Typical cable rigging chart. 

Following the manufacturer’s instructions, lower the trigger. 
Then, place the cable to be tested under the two anvils and 
close the trigger (move it up). Movement of the trigger pushes 
up the riser, which pushes the cable at right angles to the two 
clamping points under the anvils. The force that is required 
to do this is indicated by the dial pointer. As the sample chart 
beneath the illustration shows, different numbered risers are 
used with different size cables. Each riser has an identifying 
number and is easily inserted into the tensiometer.

Included with each tensiometer is a conversion chart, which is 
used to convert the dial reading to pounds. The dial reading is 
converted to pounds of tension as follows. Using a No. 2 riser 
to measure the tension of a 5/32"" diameter cable, a reading of 
30 is obtained. The actual tension (see chart) of the cable is  
70 lbs. Referring to the chart, also notice that a No. 1 riser is 
used with 1/16"", 3/32"", and 1/8"" cable. Since the tensiometer 
is not designed for use in measuring 7/32"" or 1/4"" cable, no 
values are shown in the No. 3 riser column of the chart. 

When actually taking a reading of cable tension in an aircraft, 
it may be difficult to see the dial. Therefore, a pointer lock 
is built in on the tensiometer. Push it in to lock the pointer, 

then remove the tensiometer from the cable and observe the 
reading. After observing the reading, pull the lock out and 
the pointer returns to zero.

Another variable that must be taken into account when 
adjusting cable tension is the ambient temperature of cable 
and the aircraft. To compensate for temperature variations, 
cable rigging charts are used when establishing cable tensions 
in flight control, landing gear, and other cable-operated 
systems. [Figure 2-89] 

To use the chart, determine the size of the cable that is to 
be adjusted and the ambient air temperature. For example, 
assume that the cable size is 1/8"" diameter, which is a 7-19 
cable and the ambient air temperature is 85 °F. Follow the 
85 °F line upward to where it intersects the curve for 1/8"" 
cable. Extend a horizontal line from the point of intersection 
to the right edge of the chart. The value at this point indicates 
the tension (rigging load in pounds) to establish on the cable. 
The tension for this example is 70 pounds.

Control Surface Travel
In order for a control system to function properly, it must 
be correctly adjusted. Correctly rigged control surfaces 
move through a prescribed arc (surface-throw) and are 
synchronized with the movement of the flight deck controls. 
Rigging any control system requires that the aircraft 
manufacturer’s instructions be followed as outlined in their 
maintenance manual.

Therefore, the explanations in this chapter are limited to the 
three general steps listed below: 

1. Lock the flight deck control, bellcranks, and the 
control surfaces in the neutral position. 

2. Adjust the cable tension, maintaining the rudder, 
elevators, or ailerons in the neutral position. 

3. Adjust the control stops to limit the control surface 
travel to the dimensions given for the aircraft being 
rigged. 

The range of movement of the controls and control 
surfaces should be checked in both directions from neutral. 
There are various tools used for measuring surface travel, 
including protractors, rigging fixtures, contour templates, 
and rulers. These tools are used when rigging flight control 
systems to ensure that the aircraft is properly rigged and 
the manufacturer’s specifications have been complied with. 

Rigging fixtures and contour templates are special tools 
(gauges) designed by the manufacturer to measure control 
surface travel. Markings on the fixture or template indicate 
desired control surface travel. In many instances, the aircraft 
manufacturer gives the travel of a particular control surface 
in degrees and inches. If the travel in inches is provided, a 
ruler can be used to measure surface travel in inches.

Protractors are tools for measuring angles in degrees. Various 
types of protractors are used to determine the travel of flight 
control surfaces. One protractor that can be used to measure 
aileron, elevator, or wing flap travel is the universal propeller 
protractor shown in Figure 2-90.

This protractor is made up of a frame, disk, ring, and two 
spirit levels. The disk and ring turn independently of each 
other and of the frame. (The center spirit level is used to 
position the frame vertically when measuring propeller 
blade angle.) The center spirit level is used to position the 
disk when measuring control surface travel. A disk-to-ring 
lock is provided to secure the disk and ring together when 
the zero on the ring vernier scale and the zero on the disk 
degree scale align. The ring-to-frame lock prevents the ring 
from moving when the disk is moved. Note that they start at 

the same point and advance in opposite directions. A double 
10-part vernier is marked on the ring. 

The rigging of the trim tab systems is performed in a similar 
manner. The trim tab control is set to the neutral (no trim) 
position, and the surface tab is usually adjusted to streamline 
with the control surface. However, on some aircraft, the 
specifications may require that the trim tabs be offset a degree 
or two from streamline when in the neutral position. After 
the tab and tab control are in the neutral position, adjust the 
control cable tension. 

Pins, usually called rig pins, are sometimes used to simplify 
the setting of pulleys, levers, bellcranks, etc., in their neutral 
positions. A rig pin is a small metallic pin or clip. When rig 
pins are not provided, the neutral positions can be established 
by means of alignment marks, by special templates, or by 
taking linear measurements. 

If the final alignment and adjustment of a system are correct, 
it should be possible to withdraw the rigging pins easily. Any 
undue tightness of the pins in the rigging holes indicates 
incorrect tensioning or misalignment of the system.

After a system has been adjusted, the full and synchronized 
movement of the controls should be checked. When checking 
the range of movement of the control surface, the controls 
must be operated from the flight deck and not by moving 
the control surfaces. During the checking of control surface 
travel, ensure that chains, cables, etc., have not reached 
the limit of their travel when the controls are against their 
respective stops.
 
Adjustable and nonadjustable stops (whichever the case 
requires) are used to limit the throw-range or travel movement 
of the ailerons, elevator, and rudder. Usually there are two 
sets of stops for each of the three main control surfaces. One 
set is located at the control surface, either in the snubber 
cylinders or as structural stops; the other, at the flight deck 
control. Either of these may serve as the actual limit stop. 
However, those situated at the control surface usually perform 
this function. The other stops do not normally contact each 
other, but are adjusted to a definite clearance when the 
control surface is at the full extent of its travel. These work 
as override stops to prevent stretching of cables and damage 
to the control system during violent maneuvers. When rigging 
control systems, refer to the applicable maintenance manual 
for the sequence of steps for adjusting these stops to limit the 
control surface travel. 

Where dual controls are installed, they must be synchronized 
and function satisfactorily when operated from both positions. 

Trim tabs and other tabs should be checked in a manner 
similar to the main control surfaces. The tab position 
indicator must be checked to see that it functions correctly. 
If jackscrews are used to actuate the trim tab, check to see 
that they are not extended beyond the specified limits when 
the tab is in its extreme positions. 

After determining that the control system functions properly 
and is correctly rigged, it should be thoroughly inspected to 
determine that the system is correctly assembled and operates 
freely over the specified range of movement. 

Checking and Safetying the System
Whenever rigging is performed on any aircraft, it is good 
practice to have a second set of eyes inspect the control 
system to make certain that all turnbuckles, rod ends, and 
attaching nuts and bolts are correctly safetied.

As a general rule, all fasteners on an aircraft are safetied in 
some manner. Safetying is defined as securing by various 
means any nut, bolt, turnbuckle, etc., on the aircraft so that 
vibration does not cause it to loosen during operation.

Figure 2-92. Use of safety-wire pliers or wire twisters. 

Most aircraft manufacturers have a Standard Practices section 
in their maintenance manuals. These are the methods that 
should be used when working on a particular system of a 
specific aircraft. However, most standard aircraft hardware 
has a standard method of being safetied. The following 
information provides some of the most common methods 
used in aircraft safetying. 

The most commonly used safety wire method is the double-
twist, utilizing stainless steel or Monel wire in the .032 to 
.040-inch diameter range. This method is used on studs, cable 
turnbuckles, flight controls, and engine accessory attaching 
bolts. A single-wire method is used on smaller screws, bolts, 
and/or nuts when they are located in a closely spaced or 
closed geometrical pattern. The single-wire method is also 
used on electrical components and in places that are difficult 
to reach. [Figure 2-91]

Safety-of-flight emergency equipment, such as portable fire 
extinguishers, oxygen regulators, emergency valves, firewall 
shut-offs, and seals on first-aid kits, are safetied using a 
single copper wire (.020-inch diameter) or aluminum wire 
(.031-inch diameter). The wire on this emergency equipment 
is installed only to indicate the component is sealed or has 
not been actuated. It must be possible to break the wire seal 
by hand, without the use of any tools. 

The use of safety wire pliers, or wire twisters, makes the 
job of safetying much easier on the mechanic’s hands and 
produces a better finished product. [Figure 2-92]

The wire should have six to eight twists per inch of wire and 
be pulled taut while being installed. Where practicable, install 
the safety wire around the head of the fastener and twist it in 
such a manner that the loop of the wire is pulled close to the 
contour of the unit being safety wired, and in the direction that 
would have the tendency to tighten the fastener. [Figure 2-93]

Cotter pins are used to secure such items as bolts, screws, 
pins, and shafts. They are used at any location where a turning 
or actuating movement takes place. The diameter of the cotter 
pin selected for any application should be the largest size that 
will fit consistent with the diameter of the cotter pin hole and/ 
or the slots in the castellated nut. Cotter pins, like safety wire, 
should never be re-used on aircraft. [Figure 2-94]

Self-locking nuts are used in applications where they are 
not removed often. There are two types of self-locking nuts 
currently in use. One is all metal and the other has an insert, 
usually of fiber or nylon. 

It is extremely important that the manufacturer’s Illustrated 
Parts Book (IPB) be consulted for the correct type and 
grade of lock nut for various locations on the aircraft. 
The finish or plating color of the nut identifies the type of 
application and environment in which it can be used. For 
example, a cadmium-plated nut is gold in color and provides 
exceptionally good protection against corrosion, but should 
not be used in applications where the temperature may 
exceed 450 °F.

Repeated removal and installation causes the self-locking nut 
to lose its locking feature. They should be replaced when they 
are no longer capable of maintaining the minimum prevailing 
torque. [Figure 2-95]

Lock washers may be used with bolts and machine screws 
whenever a self-locking nut or castellated nut is not 
applicable. They may be of the split washer spring type, or 
a multi-serrated internal or external star washer.

Pal nuts may be a second nut tightened against the first and 
used to force the primary nut thread against the bolt or screw
thread. They may also be of the type that are made of stamped 
spring steel and are to be used only once and replaced with 
new ones when removed.

Biplane Assembly and Rigging
Biplanes were some of the very first aircraft designs. The 
first powered heavier-than-air aircraft, the Wright Brothers’ 
Wright Flyer, successfully flown on December 17, 1903, 
was a biplane. 


2-56

Examples apply to all types of bolts, fillister-head 
screws, square-head plugs, and other similar parts 
which are wired so that the loosening tendency of 
either part is counteracted by tightening of the other 
part. The direction of twist from the second to the 
third unit is counterclockwise in examples to keep the 
loop in position against the head of the bolt. The wire 
entering the hole in the third unit is the lower 
wire, and by making a counterclockwise twist after it 
leaves the hole, the loop is secured in place 
around the head of that bolt.

Example shows methods for wiring various standard items.

NOTE: Wire may be wrapped over the unit rather than around it when wiring 
castellated nuts or on other items when there is clearance problem.

Coupling nuts on a tee shall be wired, as shown
above, so that tension is always in the tightening
direction.

Coupling nuts attached to straight connectors shall be wired as shown when hex
is an integral part of the connector.

Correct application of 
single wire to closely
spaced multiple group.

Fittings incorporating wire lugs shall be wired as shown in 7 and 8. Where no lock-wire lug is 
provided, wire should be applied as shown in 9 and 10 with caution being exerted to ensure that 
wire is wrapped tightly around the fitting.

The first biplanes were designed with very thin wing 
sections and, consequently, the wing structure needed to 
be strengthened by external bracing wires. The biplane 
configuration allowed the two wings to be braced against 
one another, increasing the structural strength. When the 
assembly and rigging of a biplane is accomplished in 
accordance with the approved instructions, a stable airworthy 
aircraft is the result. 

Whether assembling an early model vintage aircraft that 
may have been disassembled for repair and restoration, or 
constructing and assembling a new aircraft, the following are 
some basic alignment procedures to follow.

To start, the fuselage must be level, fore and aft and laterally. 
The aircraft usually has specific leveling points designated 
by the manufacturer or indicated on the plans. The fuselage 
should be blocked up off the landing gear so it is stable. A 
center line should be drawn on the floor the length of the 
fuselage and another line perpendicular to it at the firewall, 
for use as an additional alignment reference. 

With the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces installed, the 
incident angle for the horizontal stabilizer should be set. 
The tail brace wires should be connected and tightened until 
the slack is removed. Alignment measurements should be 
checked as shown in Figure 2-96.

Install the elevator and rudder and clamp them in a neutral

and rudder pedals in the flight deck and secure them in 
order to simplify the connecting and final tensioning of 
the control cables.

If the biplane has a center section for the upper wing, it 
must be aligned as accurately as possible, because even the 
smallest error is compounded at the wing tip. Applicable 
cables and turnbuckles should be connected and the tension 
set as specified. [Figure 2-97] The stagger measurement can 
be checked as shown in Figure 2-98. 

The lower wing sections should be individually attached to 
the fuselage and blocked up for support while the landing 
wires are connected and adjusted to obtain the dihedral called 
for in the specifications or plans. [Figure 2-99]

Next, connect the outer “N” struts to the left and right sections 
of the lower wing. Now, the upper wing can be attached and 
the flying wires installed. The slave struts can be installed 
and the ailerons connected using the same alignment and 
adjustment procedures used for the elevator and rudder. The 
incidence angle can be checked, as shown in Figure 2-100.

Once this point is reached, it is a matter of measuring, 
checking angles, and adjusting the various components to 
obtain the overall aircraft symmetry and desired alignment, 
as shown in Figure 2-96.

Also, remember that care should be used when tightening 
the wing wires because extra stress can be inadvertently 
induced into the wings. Always loosen one wire before 
tightening the opposite wire. Flying and landing wires are 
typically set at about 600 pounds and tail brace wires at 
about 300 pounds of tension. 

When convinced the aircraft is properly rigged, move away 
from it and take a good look at the finished product. Are the 
wings symmetrical? Does the dihedral look even? Is the tail 
section square with the fuselage? Are the wing attaching 
hardware, flying wires, and control cables safetied? And 
the final task, before the first flight, is to complete the 
maintenance record entries. 

As with any aircraft maintenance or repair, the instructions 
and specifications from the manufacturer, or the procedures 
and recommendations found in the construction plans, should 
be the primary method to perform the assembly and rigging 
of the aircraft.  

Aircraft Inspection
Purpose of Inspection Programs 
The purpose of an aircraft inspection program is to ensure that 
the aircraft is airworthy. The term airworthy is not defined 
in the 14 CFR. However, case law relating to the term and 
regulations for the issuance of a standard airworthiness 
certificate reveal two conditions that must be met for the 
aircraft to be considered airworthy: 

1. The aircraft must conform to its type design or 
properly altered condition. Conformity to type design 
is considered attained when the aircraft configuration 
and the components installed are consistent with 
the drawings, specifications, and other data that are 
part of the TC, which includes any supplemental 
type certificate (STC) and field approved alterations 
incorporated into the aircraft.

2. The aircraft must be in a condition for safe operation. 
This refers to the condition of the aircraft relative to 
wear and deterioration (e.g., skin corrosion, window 
delamination/crazing, fluid leaks, and tire wear 
beyond specified limits).

When flight hours and calendar time are accumulated into 
the life of an aircraft, some components wear out and others 
deteriorate. Inspections are developed to find these items, and 
repair or replace them before they affect the airworthiness 
of the aircraft.

Perform an Airframe Conformity and 
Airworthiness Inspection
To establish conformity of an aircraft product, start with a 
TCDS. This document is a formal description of the aircraft, 
the engine, or the propeller. It is issued by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) when they find that the 
product meets the applicable requirements for certification 
under 14 CFR.

The TCDS lists the limitations and information required 
for type certification of aircraft. It includes the certification 
basis and eligible serial numbers for the product. It lists 
airspeed limits, weight limits, control surface movements, 
engine make and models, minimum crew, fuel type, etc.; the 
horsepower and rpm limits, thrust limitations, size and weight 
for engines; and blade diameter, pitch, etc., for propellers. 


2-60

Additionally, it provides all the various components by make 
and model, eligible for installation on the applicable product.

A manufacturer’s maintenance information may be in the 
form of service instructions, service bulletins, or service 
letters that the manufacturer publishes to provide instructions 
for product improvement or to revise and update maintenance 
manuals. Service bulletins are not regulatory unless:

1. All or a portion of a service bulletin is incorporated 
as part of an airworthiness directive.

2. The service bulletins are part of the FAA-approved 
airworthiness limitations section of the manufacturer’s 
manual or part of the type certificate.

3. The service bulletins are incorporated directly or by 
reference into an FAA-approved inspection program, 
such as an approved aircraft inspection program 
(AAIP) or continuous aircraft maintenance program 
(CAMP).

4. The service bulletins are listed as an additional 
maintenance requirement in a certificate holder’s 
operations specifications (Op Specs).

 
Airworthiness directives (ADs) are published by the FAA 
as amendments to 14 CFR part 39, section 39.13. They 
apply to the following products: aircraft, aircraft engines, 
propellers, and appliances. The FAA issues airworthiness 
directives when an unsafe condition exists in a product, and 
the condition is likely to exist or develop in other products 
of the same type design.

To perform the airframe conformity and verify the 
airworthiness of the aircraft, records must be checked and 
the aircraft inspected. The data plate on the airframe is 
inspected to verify its make, model, serial number, type 
certificate, or production certificate. Check the registration 
and airworthiness certificate to verify they are correct and 
reflect the “N” number on the aircraft.

Inspect aircraft records. Check current inspection status of 
aircraft, by verifying:

• The date of the last inspection and aircraft total time 
in service.

• The type of inspection and if it includes manufacturer’s 
bulletins. 

• The signature, certificate number, and the type of 
certificate of the person who returned the aircraft to 
service.

Identify if any major alterations or major repairs have been 
performed and recorded on an FAA Form 337, Major Repair 

and Alteration. Review any flight manual supplements 
(FMS) included in the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH)
and determine if there are any airworthiness limitations or 
required placards associated with the installation(s) that must 
be inspected.

Check for a current weight and balance report, and the current 
equipment list, current status of airworthiness directives for 
airframe, engine, propeller, and appliances. Also, check the 
limitations section of the manufacturer’s manual to verify 
the status of any life-limited components.

Obtain the latest revision of the airframe TCDS and use it 
as a verification document to inspect and ensure the correct 
engines, propellers, and components are installed on the 
airframe. 

Required Inspections
Preflight
Preflight for the aircraft is described in the POH for that 
specific aircraft and should be followed with the same 
attention given to the checklists for takeoff, inflight, and 
landing checklists. 
 
Periodic Maintenance Inspections
Annual Inspection

With few exceptions, no person may operate an aircraft 
unless, within the preceding 12 calendar months, it has had 
an annual inspection in accordance with 14 CFR part 43 and 
was approved for return to service by a person authorized 
under section 43.7. (A certificated mechanic with an Airframe 
and Powerplant (A&P) rating must hold an inspection 
authorization (IA) to perform an annual inspection.) A 
checklist must be used and include as a minimum, the scope 
and detail of items (as applicable to the particular aircraft) in 
14 CFR part 43, Appendix D.

100-hour Inspection

This inspection is required when an aircraft is operated under 
14 CFR part 91 and used for hire, such as flight training. It 
is required to be performed every 100 hours of service in 
addition to the annual inspection. (The inspection may be 
performed by a certificated mechanic with an A&P rating.) 
A checklist must be used and as a minimum, the inspection 
must include the scope and detail of items (as applicable to 
the particular aircraft) in 14 CFR part 43, Appendix D.
  
Progressive Inspection

This inspection program can be performed under 14 CFR 
part 91, section 91.409(d), as an alternative to an annual 
inspection. However, the program requires that a written 


2-61

request be submitted by the registered owner or operator 
of an aircraft desiring to use a progressive inspection to the 
local FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO). It shall 
provide:

1. The name of a certificated mechanic holding an 
inspection authorization, a certificated airframe repair 
station, or the manufacturer of the aircraft to supervise 
or conduct the inspection. 

2. A current inspection procedures manual available and 
readily understandable to the pilot and maintenance 
personnel containing in detail:

• An explanation of the progressive inspection, 
including the continuity of inspection 
responsibility, the making of reports, and the 
keeping of records and technical reference 
material.

• An inspection schedule, specifying the intervals 
in hours or days when routine and detailed 
inspections will be performed, and including 
instructions for exceeding an inspection interval 
by not more than 10 hours while en route, and 
for changing an inspection interval because of 
service experience.

• Sample routine and detailed inspection forms and 
instructions for their use.

• Sample reports and records and instructions for 
their use.

3. Enough housing and equipment for necessary 
disassembly and proper inspection of the aircraft.

4. Appropriate current technical information for the 
aircraft.

The frequency and detail of the progressive inspection 
program shall provide for the complete inspection of the 
aircraft within each 12 calendar months and be consistent with 
the manufacturer’s recommendations and kind of operation 
in which the aircraft is engaged. The progressive inspection 
schedule must ensure that the aircraft will be airworthy 
at all times. A certificated A&P mechanic may perform a 
progressive inspection, as long as he or she is being supervised 
by a mechanic holding an Inspection Authorization.

If the progressive inspection is discontinued, the owner or 
operator must immediately notify the local FAA FSDO in 
writing. After discontinuance, the first annual inspection 
will be due within 12 calendar months of the last complete 
inspection of the aircraft under the progressive inspection.

Large Airplanes (over 12,500 lb)

Inspection requirements of 14 CFR part 91, section 91.409, 
to include paragraphs (e) and (f).

Paragraph (e) applies to large airplanes (to which 14 CFR 
part 125 is not applicable), turbojet multiengine airplanes, 
turbo propeller powered multiengine airplanes, and turbine-
powered rotorcraft. Paragraph (f) lists the inspection 
programs that can be selected under paragraph (e).

The additional inspection requirements for these aircraft are 
placed on the operator because the larger aircraft typically 
are more complex and require a more detailed inspection 
program than is provided for in 14 CFR part 43, Appendix D. 

An inspection program must be selected from one of the 
following four options by the owner or operator of the aircraft:

1. A continuous airworthiness inspection program that 
is part of a continuous airworthiness maintenance 
program currently in use by a person holding an air 
carrier operating certificate or an operating certificate 
issued under 14 CFR part 121 or 135.

2. An approved aircraft inspection program approved 
under 14 CFR part 135, section 135.419, and currently 
in use by a person holding an operating certificate 
issued under 14 CFR part 135.

3. A current inspection program recommended by the 
manufacturer.

4. Any other inspection program established by the 
registered owner or operator of the airplane or turbine-
powered rotorcraft and approved by the FAA. This 
program must be submitted to the local FAA FSDO 
having jurisdiction of the area in which the aircraft is 
based. The program must be in writing and include at 
least the following information:

(a) Instructions and procedures for the conduct of 
inspections for the particular make and model 
airplane or turbine-powered rotorcraft, including 
the necessary tests and checks. The instructions 
and procedures must set forth in detail the parts 
and areas of the airframe, engines, propellers, 
rotors, and appliances, including survival and 
emergency equipment, required to be inspected.

(b) A schedule for performing the inspections that 
must be performed under the program expressed 
in terms of the time in service, calendar time, 
number of system operations (cycles), or any 
combination of these.


2-62

 This FAA approved owner/operator program can 
be revised at a future date by the FAA, if they 
find that revisions are necessary for the continued 
adequacy of the program. The owner/operator can 
petition the FAA within 30 days of notification 
to reconsider the notice to make changes.

Manufacturer’s Inspection Program

This is a program developed by the manufacturer for their 
product. It is contained in the “Instructions for Continued 
Airworthiness” required under 14 CFR part 23, section 23.1529 
and part 25, section 25.1529. It is in the form of a manual, or 
manuals as appropriate, for the quantity of data to be provided 
and including, but not limited to, the following content:

• A description of the airplane and its systems and 
installations, including its engines, propellers, and 
appliances.

• Basic information describing how the airplane 
components and systems are controlled and operated, 
including any special procedures and limitations that 
apply.

• Servicing information that covers servicing points, 
capacities of tanks, reservoirs, types of fluids to be 
used, pressures applicable to the various systems, 
lubrication points, lubricants to be used, equipment 
required for servicing, tow instructions, mooring, 
jacking, and leveling information.

• Maintenance instructions with scheduling information 
for the airplane and each component that provides 
the recommended periods at which they should be 
cleaned, inspected, adjusted, tested, and lubricated, 
and the degree of inspection and work recommended 
at these periods.

• The recommended overhaul periods and necessary 
cross references to the airworthiness limitations 
section of the manual.

• The inspection program that details the frequency and 
extent of the inspections necessary to provide for the 
continued airworthiness of the airplane.

• Diagrams of structural access plates and information 
needed to gain access for inspections when access 
plates are not provided.

• Details for the application of special inspection 
techniques, including radiographic and ultrasonic 
testing where such processes are specified.

• A list of special tools needed.

• An Airworthiness Limitations section that is 
segregated and clearly distinguishable from the rest 
of the document. This section must set forth—

1. Each mandatory replacement time, structural 
inspection interval, and related structural inspection 
procedures required for type certification or 
approved under 14 CFR part 23 or part 25.

2. Each mandatory replacement time, inspection 
interval, related inspection procedure, and all 
critical design configuration control limitations 
approved under 14 CFR part 23 or part 25, for 
the fuel tank system.

The Airworthiness Limitations section must contain a 
legible statement in a prominent location that reads: “The 
Airworthiness Limitations section is FAA-approved and 
specifies maintenance required under 14 CFR part 43, 
sections 43.16 and part 91, section 91.403, unless an 
alternative program has been FAA-approved.”

Any operator who wishes to adopt a manufacturers’ 
inspection program should first contact their local FAA Flight 
Standards District Office, for further guidance.

Altimeter and Static System Inspections in Accordance 
with 4 CFR Part 91, Section 91.411
Any person operating an airplane or helicopter in controlled 
airspace under instrument flight rules (IFR) must have had, 
within the preceding 24 calendar months, each static pressure 
system, each altimeter instrument, and each automatic 
pressure altitude reporting system tested and inspected and 
found to comply with 14 CFR part 43, Appendix E. Those 
test and inspections must be conducted by appropriately rated 
persons under 14 CFR.

Air Traffic Control (ATC) Transponder Inspections
Any person using an air traffic control (ATC) transponder 
must have had, within the preceding 24 calendar months, that 
transponder tested and inspected and found to comply with 
14 CFR part 43, Appendix F, and part 91, section 91.411. 
Additionally, following any installation or maintenance on 
an ATC transponder where data correspondence error could 
be introduced, the integrated system must be tested and 
inspected and found to comply with 14 CFR part part 43, 
Appendix E, and part 91, section 91.411 by an appropriately 
person under 14 CFR.

Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Operational 
and Maintenance Practices in Accordance With 
Advisory Circular (AC) 91-44 
This AC combined and updated several ACs on the subject 
of ELTs and receivers for airborne service. 

Under the operating rules of 14 CFR part 91, most small U.S. 
registered civil airplanes equipped to carry more than one 


2-63

person must have an ELT attached to the airplane. 14 CFR 
part 91, section 91.207 defines the requirements of what type 
aircraft and when the ELT must be installed. It also states that 
an ELT that meets the requirements of Technical Standard 
Order (TSO)-C91 may not be used for new installations.

The pilot in command of an aircraft equipped with an ELT is 
responsible for its operation and, prior to engine shutdown at 
the end of each flight, should tune the VHF receiver to 121.5 
MHz and listen for ELT activations. Maintenance personnel 
are responsible for accidental activation during the actual 
period of their work.

Maintenance of ELTs is subject to 14 CFR part 43 and 
part 91, section 91.413 and should be included in the 
required inspections. It is essential that the impact switch 
operation and the transmitter output be checked using the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Testing of an ELT prior to 
installation or for maintenance reasons, should be conducted 
in a metal enclosure in order to avoid outside radiation by the 
transmitter. If this is not possible, the test should be conducted 
only within the first 5 minutes after any hour.

Manufacturers of ELTs are required to mark the expiration 
date of the battery, based on 50 percent of the useful life, on 
the outside of the transmitter. The batteries are required to be 
replaced on that date or when the transmitter has been in use 
for more than 1 cumulative hour. Water activated batteries, 
have virtually unlimited shelf life. They are not usually 
marked with an expiration date. They must be replaced after 
activation regardless of how long they were in service.

The battery replacement can be accomplished by a pilot on 
a portable type ELT that is readily accessible and can be 
removed and reinstalled in the aircraft by a simple operation. 
That would be considered preventive maintenance under 
14 CFR part 43, section 43.3(g). Replacement batteries 
should be approved for the specific model of ELT and the 
installation performed in accordance with section 43.13. 

AC 91-44 also contains additional information on:

• Airborne homing and alerting equipment for use with 
ELTs.

• Search and rescue responsibility.

• Alert and search procedures including various flight 
procedures for locating an ELT.

• The FAA Frequency Management Offices, for 
contacting by manufacturers when they are 
demonstrating and testing ELTs.

Although there is no regulatory requirement to install a 406 
ELT, the benefits are numerous, regardless of regulatory 

minimums. All new installations must be a 406 MHz digital 
ELT. It must meet the standards of TSO C126. When 
installed, the new 406 MHz ELT should be registered so that 
if the aircraft were to go down, search and rescue could take 
full advantage of the benefits the system offers. The digital 
circuitry of the 406 ELT can be coded with information about 
the aircraft type, base location, ownership, etc. This coding 
allows the search and rescue (SAR) coordinating centers to 
contact the registered owner or operator if a signal is detected 
to determine if the aircraft is flying or parked. This type of 
identification permits a rapid SAR response in the event of 
an accident, and will save valuable resources from a false 
alarm search.

Annual and 100-Hour Inspections
Preparation 
An owner/operator bringing an aircraft into a maintenance 
facility for an annual or 100-hour inspection may not know 
what is involved in the process. This is the point at which 
the person who performs the inspection sits down with the 
customer to review the records and discuss any maintenance 
issues, repairs needed, or additional work the customer may 
want done. Moreover, the time spent on these items before 
starting the inspection usually saves time and money before 
the work is completed. 

The work order describes the work that will be performed 
and the fee that the owner pays for the service. It is a contract 
that includes the parts, materials, and labor to complete the 
inspection. It may also include additional maintenance and 
repairs requested by the owner or found during the inspection. 

Additional materials such as ADs, manufacturer’s service 
bulletins and letters, and vendor service information must be 
researched to include the avionics and emergency equipment 
on the aircraft. The TCDS provides all the components 
eligible for installation on the aircraft.

The review of the aircraft records is one of the most important 
parts of any inspection. Those records provide the history 
of the aircraft. The records to be kept and how they are to 
be maintained are listed in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.417. 
Among those records that must be tracked are records of 
maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration, records 
of the last 100-hour, annual, or other required or approved 
inspections for the airframe, engine propeller, rotor, and 
appliances of an aircraft. The records must include:

• A description (or reference to data acceptable to the 
FAA) of the work performed. 

• The date of completion of the work performed and 
the signature and certificate number of the person 
approving the aircraft for return to service.


2-64

• The total time in service and the current status of 
life-limited parts of the airframe, each engine, each 
propeller, and each rotor.

• The time since last overhaul of all items installed on 
the aircraft which are required to be overhauled on a 
specified time basis.

• The current inspection status of the aircraft, including 
the time since last inspection required by the program 
under which the aircraft and its appliances are 
maintained.

• The current status of applicable ADs including for 
each, the method of compliance, the AD number, and 
revision date. If the AD involves recurring action, the 
time and date when the next action is required. 

• Copies of the forms prescribed by 14 CFR part 43, 
section 43.9, for each major alteration to the airframe 
and currently installed components.

The owner/operator is required to retain the records of 
inspection until the work is repeated, or for 1 year after the 
work is performed. Most of the other records that include 
total times and current status of life-limited parts, overhaul 
times, and AD status must be retained and transferred with 
the aircraft when it is sold.

14 CFR part 43, part 43.15, requires that each person 
performing a 100-hour or annual inspection shall use a 
checklist while performing the inspection. The checklist 
may be one developed by the person, one provided by the 
manufacturer of the equipment being inspected, or one 
obtained from another source. The checklist must include the 
scope and detail of the items contained in part 43, Appendix D.

The inspection checklist provided by the manufacturer is 
the preferred one to use. The manufacturer separates the 
areas to inspect such as engine, cabin, wing, empennage 
and landing gear. They typically list Service Bulletins and 
Service Letters for specific areas of the aircraft and the 
appliances that are installed.
  
Initial run-up provides an assessment to the condition of the 
engine prior to performing the inspection. The run-up should 
include full power and idle rpm, magneto operation, including 
positive switch grounding, fuel mixture check, oil and fuel 
pressure, and cylinder head and oil temperatures. After the 
engine run, check it for fuel, oil, and hydraulic leaks. 

Following the checklist, the entire aircraft shall be opened 
by removing all necessary inspection plates, access doors, 
fairings, and cowling. The entire aircraft must then be cleaned 
to uncover hidden cracks or defects that may have been 
missed because of the dirt. 

Following in order and using the checklist visually inspect each 
item, or perform the checks or tests necessary to verify the 
condition of the component or system. Record discrepancies 
when they are found. The entire aircraft should be inspected 
and a list of discrepancies be presented to the owner. 

A typical inspection following a checklist, on a small single-
engine airplane may include in part, as applicable:

• The fuselage for damage, corrosion, and attachment 
of fittings, antennas, and lights; for “smoking rivets” 
especially in the landing gear area indicating the 
possibility of structural movement or hidden failure.

• The flight deck and cabin area for loose equipment 
that could foul the controls; seats and seat belts for 
defects; windows and windshields for deterioration; 
instruments for condition, markings, and operation; 
flight and engine controls for proper operation.

• The engine and attached components for visual 
evidence of leaks; studs and nuts for improper torque 
and obvious defects; engine mount and vibration 
dampeners for cracks, deterioration, and looseness; 
engine controls for defects, operation, and safetying; 
the internal engine for cylinder compression; spark 
plugs for operation; oil screens and filters for metal 
particles or foreign matter; exhaust stacks and mufflers 
for leaks, cracks, and missing hardware; cooling 
baffles for deterioration, damage, and missing seals; 
and engine cowling for cracks and defects.

• The landing gear group for condition and attachment; 
shock absorbing devices for leaks and fluid levels; 
retracting and locking mechanism for defects, damage, 
and operation; hydraulic lines for leakage; electrical 
system for chafing and switches for operation; wheels 
and bearings for condition; tires for wear and cuts; and 
brakes for condition and adjustment.

• The wing and center section assembly for condition, 
skin deterioration, distortion, structural failure, and 
attachment.

• The empennage assembly for condition, distortion, 
skin deterioration, evidence of failure (smoking 
rivets), secure attachment, and component operation 
and installation.

• The propeller group and system components for torque 
and proper safetying; the propeller for nicks, cracks, 
and oil leaks; the anti-icing devices for defects and 
operation; and the control mechanism for operation, 
mounting, and restricted movement.

• The radios and electronic equipment for improper 
installation and mounting; wiring and conduits for 
improper routing, insecure mounting, and obvious 


2-65

defects; bonding and shielding for installation and 
condition; and all antennas for condition, mounting, 
and operation. Additionally, if not already inspected 
and serviced, the main battery inspected for condition, 
mounting, corrosion, and electrical charge.

• Any and all installed miscellaneous items and 
components that are not otherwise covered by this 
listing for condition and operation. 

With the aircraft inspection checklist completed, the list 
of discrepancies should be transferred to the work order. 
As part of the annual and 100-hour inspections, the engine 
oil is drained and replaced because new filters and/or clean 
screens have been installed in the engine. The repairs are 
then completed and all fluid systems serviced.

Before approving the aircraft for return to service after 
the annual or 100-hour inspection, 14 CFR states that the 
engine must be run to determine satisfactory performance in 
accordance with the manufacturers recommendations. The 
run must include:

• Power output (static and idle rpm)

• Magnetos (for drop and switch ground)

• Fuel and oil pressure

• Cylinder and oil temperature

After the run, the engine is inspected for fluid leaks and the oil 
level is checked a final time before close up of the cowling.

With the aircraft inspection completed, all inspections plates, 
access doors, fairing and cowling that were removed, must 
be reinstalled. It is a good practice to visually check inside 
the inspection areas for tools, shop rags, etc., prior to close 
up. Using the checklist and discrepancy list to review areas 
that were repaired will help ensure the aircraft is properly 
returned to service.

Upon completion of the inspection, the records for each 
airframe, engine, propeller, and appliance must be signed off. 
The record entry in accordance with 14 CFR part 43, section 
43.11, must include the following information:

• The type inspection and a brief description of the 
extent of the inspection.

• The date of the inspection and aircraft total time in 
service.

• The signature, the certificate number, and kind 
of certificate held by the person approving or 
disapproving for return to service the aircraft, airframe, 
aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, component part, 
or portions thereof.

• For the annual and 100-hour inspection, if the aircraft 
is found to be airworthy and approved for return to 
service, enter the following statement: “I certify that 
this aircraft has been inspected in accordance with a 
(insert type) inspection and was determined to be in 
airworthy condition.”

• If the aircraft is not approved for return to service 
because of necessary maintenance, noncompliance 
with applicable specifications, airworthiness 
directives, or other approved data, enter the following 
statement: “I certify that this aircraft has been 
inspected in accordance with a (insert type) inspection 
and a list of discrepancies and unairworthy items has 
been provided to the aircraft owner or operator.” 

   
If the owner or operator did not want the discrepancies and/
or unairworthy items repaired at the location where the 
inspection was accomplished, they may have the option of 
flying the aircraft to another location with a Special Flight 
Permit (Ferry Permit). An application for a Special Flight 
Permit can be made at the local FAA FSDO. 

Other Aircraft Inspection and Maintenance Programs
Aircraft operating under 14 CFR part 135, Commuter and On 
Demand, have additional rules for maintenance that must be 
followed beyond those in 14 CFR parts 43 and 91. 

14 CFR part 135, section 135.411 describes the applicable 
sections for maintaining aircraft that are type certificated for 
a passenger seating configuration, excluding any pilot seat, 
of nine seats or less, and which sections are applicable to 
maintaining aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats. The 
following sections apply to aircraft with nine seats or less:

• Section 135.415—requires each certificate holder to 
submit a Service Difficulty Report, whenever they 
have an occurrence, failure, malfunction, or defect in 
an aircraft concerning the list detailed in this section 
of the regulation. 

• Section 135.417—requires each certificate holder 
to mail or deliver a Mechanical Interruption Report, 
for occurrences in multi-engine aircraft, concerning 
unscheduled flight interruptions, and the number 
of propeller featherings in flight, as detailed in this 
section of the regulation. 

• Section 135.421—requires each certificate holder 
to comply with the manufacturer’s recommended 
maintenance programs, or a program approved by 
the FAA for each aircraft, engine, propeller, rotor, 
and each item of emergency required by 14 CFR part 
135. This section also details requirements for single-
engine IFR passenger-carrying operations.


2-66

• Section 135.422—this section applies to multi-engine 
airplanes and details requirements for Aging Airplane 
Inspections and Records review. It excludes airplanes 
in schedule operations between any point within the 
State of Alaska. 

Any certificated operator using aircraft with ten or more 
passenger seats must have the required organization 
and maintenance programs, along with competent and 
knowledgeable people to ensure a safe operation. Title 14 
of the CFR, sections 135.423 through 135.443 are numerous 
and complex, and compliance is required; however, they are 
not summarized in this handbook. It is the responsibility of 
the certificated operator to know and comply with these and 
all other applicable equirements of 14 CFR, and they should 
contact their local FAA FSDO for further guidance.

The approved aircraft inspection program (AAIP) is an 
FAA-approved inspection program for aircraft of nine or 
less passenger seats operated under 14 CFR part 135. The 
AAIP is an operator developed program tailored to their 
particular needs to satisfy aircraft inspection requirements. 
This program allows operators to develop procedures and 
time intervals for the accomplishment of inspection tasks in 
accordance with the needs of the aircraft, rather than repeat 
all the tasks at each 100-hour interval. 

The operator is responsible for the AAIP. The program must 
encompass the total aircraft; including all avionics equipment, 
emergency equipment, cargo provisions, etc. FAA Advisory 
Circular 135-10 (as revised) provides detailed guidance 
to develop an approved aircraft inspection program. The 
following is a summary, in part, of elements that the program 
should include:

• A schedule of individual tasks (inspections) or groups 
of tasks, as well as the frequency for performing those 
tasks.

• Work forms designating those tasks with a signoff 
provision for each. The forms may be developed by 
the operator or obtained from another source.

• Instructions for accomplishing each task. These 
tasks must satisfy 14 CFR part 43, section 43.13(a), 
regarding methods, techniques, practices, tools, and 
equipment. The instructions should include adequate 
information in a form suitable for use by the person 
performing the work.

• Provisions for operator-developed revisions to 
referenced instructions should be incorporated in the 
operator’s manual.

• A system for recording discrepancies and their 
correction.

• A means for accounting for work forms upon 
completion of the inspection. These forms are used 
to satisfy the requirements of 14 CFR part 91, section 
91.417, so they must be complete, legible, and 
identifiable as to the aircraft and specific inspection 
to which they relate.

• Accommodation for variations in equipment and 
configurations between aircraft in the fleet.

• Provisions for transferring an aircraft from another 
program to the AAIP. 

The development of the AAIP may come from one of the 
following sources:

• An adoption of an aircraft manufacturer’s inspection 
in its entirety. However, many aircraft manufacturers’ 
programs do not encompass avionics, emergency 
equipment, appliances, and related installations that 
must be incorporated into the AAIP. The inspection of 
these items and systems will require additions to the 
program to ensure they comply with the air carrier’s 
operation specifications and as applicable to 14 CFR. 

• A modified manufacturer’s program. The operator 
may modify a manufacturer’s inspection program 
to suit its needs. Modifications should be clearly 
identified and provide an equivalent level of safety 
to those in the manufacturer’s approved program.

• An operator-developed program. This type of program 
is developed in its entirety by the operator. It should 
include methods, techniques, practices, and standards 
necessary for proper accomplishment of the program.

• An existing progressive inspection program (14 CFR 
part 91.409(d)) may be used as a basis for the 
development of an AAIP.

As part of this inspection program, the FAA strongly 
recommends that a Corrosion Protection Control Program 
and a supplemental structural inspection type program be 
included.

A program revision procedure should be included so that an 
evaluation of any revision can be made by the operator prior 
to submitting them to the FAA for approval. 
   
Procedures for administering the program should be 
established. These should include: defining the duties and 
responsibilities for all personnel involved in the program, 
scheduling inspections, recording their accomplishment, and 
maintaining a file of completed work forms. 
 
The operator’s manual should include a section that clearly 
describes the complete program, including procedures 


2-67

for program scheduling, recording, and accountability 
for continuing accomplishment of the program. This 
section serves to facilitate administration of the program 
by the certificate holder and to direct its accomplishment 
by mechanics or repair stations. The operator’s manual 
should include instructions to accomplish the maintenance/
inspections tasks. It should also contain a list of the 
necessary tools and equipment needed to perform the 
maintenance and inspections.

The FAA FSDO will provide each operator with computer-
generated Operations Specifications when they approve the 
program.
   
Continuous Airworthiness Maintenance Program 
(CAMP)
The definition of maintenance in 14 CFR part 1 includes 
inspection. The inspection program required for 14 CFR 
part 121 and part 135 air carriers is part of the Continuous 
Airworthiness Maintenance Program (CAMP). CAMP is 
not required of every part 135 carrier; it depends on aircraft 
being operated. It is a complex program that requires an 
organization of experienced and knowledgeable aviation 
personnel to implement it. 

The FAA has developed an Advisory Circular, AC 120-16 (as 
revised) Air Carrier Maintenance Programs, which explains 
the background as well as the FAA regulatory requirements 
for these programs. The AC applies to air carriers subject to 
14 CFR parts 119, 121, and 135. For part 135, it applies only 
to aircraft type certificated with ten or more passenger seats.

Any person wanting to place their aircraft on this type of 
program should contact their local FAA FSDO for guidance. 

Title 14 CFR part 125, section 125.247, Inspection 
Programs and Maintenance
This regulation applies to airplanes having a seating capacity 
of 20 or more passengers or a maximum payload capacity 
of 6,000 pounds or more when the aircraft is not required 
to be operated under 14 CFR parts 121, 129, 135, and 137. 
Inspection programs which may be approved for use under 
this 14 CFR part include, but are not limited to:

1. A continuous inspection program which is part of a 
current continuous airworthiness program approved 
for use by a certificate holder under 14 CFR part 121 
or part 135;

2. Inspection programs currently recommended by 
the manufacturer of the airplane, airplane engines, 
propellers, appliances, or survival and emergency 
equipment; or

3. An inspection program developed by a certificate 
holder under 14 CFR part 125.

 The airplane subject to this part may not be operated 
unless:

• The replacement times for life-limited parts 
specified in the aircraft type certificate data 
sheets, or other documents approved by the FAA 
are complied with;

• Defects disclosed between inspections, or as 
a result of inspection, have been corrected in 
accordance with 14 CFR part 43; and

• The airplane, including airframe, aircraft 
engines, propellers, appliances, and survival and 
emergency equipment, and their component parts, 
is inspected in accordance with an inspection 
program approved by the FAA. These inspections 
must include at least the following:

○ Instructions, procedures and standards for 
the particular make and model of airplane, 
including tests and checks. The instructions 
and procedures must set forth in detail the 
parts and areas of the airframe, aircraft 
engines, propellers, appliances, and survival 
and emergency equipment required to be 
inspected.

○ A schedule for the performance of the 
inspections that must be performed under 
the program, expressed in terms of the time 
in service, calendar time, number of system 
operations, or any combination of these.

○ The person used to perform the inspections 
required by 14 CFR part 125, must be 
authorized to perform maintenance under 
14 CFR part 43. The airplane subject to 
part 125 may not be operated unless the 
installed engines have been maintained 
in accordance with the overhaul periods 
recommended by the manufacturer or a 
program approved by the FAA; the engine 
overhaul periods are specified in the 
inspection programs required by 14 CFR 
part 125, section 125.247.

Helicopter Inspections, Piston-Engine and Turbine-
Powered 
A piston-engine helicopter must be inspected in accordance 
with the scope and detail of 14 CFR part 43, Appendix D 
for an Annual Inspection. However, there are additional 
performance rules for inspections under 14 CFR part 43, 


2-68

section 43.15, requiring that each person performing an 
inspection under 14 CFR part 91 on a rotorcraft shall 
inspect these additional components in accordance with 
the maintenance manual or Instructions for Continued 
Airworthiness of the manufacturer concerned:

1. The drive shaft or similar systems

2. The main rotor transmission gear box for obvious 
defects

3. The main rotor and center section (or the equivalent 
area)

4. The auxiliary rotor

The operator of a turbine-powered helicopter can elect to have 
it inspected under 14 CFR part 91, section 91.409:

1. Annual inspection 

2. 100-hour inspection, when being used for compensation 

or hire.

3. A progressive inspection, when authorized by the 
FAA.

4. An inspection program listed under 14 CFR part 
91, section 91.409 (f), when selected by the owner/
operator and the selection is recorded in the aircraft 
maintenance records (14 CFR part 91, section 
91.409(e)).

When performing any of the above inspections, the additional 
performance rules under 14 CFR part 43, section 43.15, for 
rotorcraft must be complied with.

Light Sport Aircraft and Aircraft Certificated as 
Experimental 
Light sport aircraft and aircraft that are certificated in the 
experimental category are issued a Special Airworthiness 
Certificate by the FAA. Operating limitations are issued to 
these aircraft as a part of the Special Airworthiness Certificate 
that specify the required inspections and inspection intervals 
for the aircraft.  

Typically, the operating limitations issued to these aircraft 
require that a condition inspection be performed once 
every 12 months. If the aircraft is used for compensation 
or hire (e.g., towing a glider, flight training), then it must 
also be inspected each 100 hours. A condition inspection is 
equivalent to the scope and detail of an annual inspection, 
the requirements of which are outlined in 14 CFR part 43, 
Appendix D.

An A&P or an appropriately rated repair station can perform 
the condition  inspection on any of these aircraft. The 
FAA issues repairman certificates to individuals who are 
the builder of an amateur-built aircraft, which authorizes 
performance of the condition inspection. Additionally, 
repairman certificates can be issued to individuals for 
conducting inspections on light sport aircraft. There are two 
ratings available for light sport repairman certificate, each 
with different privileges as described in 14 CFR part 65, 
section 65.107, but both ratings authorize the repairman to 
conduct the annual condition inspection. 

The operating limitations issued to the aircraft also require 
that the condition inspection be recorded in the aircraft 
maintenance records. The following or similarly worded 
statement is used:  

“I certify that this aircraft has been inspected on [insert 
date] per the [insert either: scope and detail of 14 CFR part 
43, Appendix D; or manufacturer’s inspection procedures] 
and was found to be in a condition for safe operation.” The 
entry will include the aircraft’s total time-in-service (cycles 
if appropriate), and the name, signature, certificate number, 
and type of certificate held by the person performing the 
inspection.

Aircraft Fabric 
Covering
General History
Fabric-covered aircraft play an important role in the history of 
aviation. The famous Wright Flyer utilized a fabric-covered 
wood frame in its design, and fabric covering continued 
to be used by many aircraft designers and builders during 
the early decades of production aircraft. The use of fabric 
covering on an aircraft offers one primary advantage: light 
weight. In contrast, fabric coverings have two disadvantages: 
flammability and lack of durability. 


3-2

Figure 3-1. Examples of aircraft produced using fabric skin. 

Finely woven organic fabrics, such as Irish linen and cotton, 
were the original fabrics used for covering airframes, but 
their tendency to sag left the aircraft structure exposed to the 
elements. To counter this problem, builders began coating the 
fabrics with oils and varnishes. In 1916, a mixture of cellulose 
dissolved in nitric acid, called nitrate dope, came into use as 
an aircraft fabric coating. Nitrate dope protected the fabric, 
adhered to it well, and tautened it over the airframe. It also 
gave the fabric a smooth, durable finish when dried. The 
major drawback to nitrate dope was its extreme flammability.

To address the flammability issue, aircraft designers tried 
a preparation of cellulose dissolved in butyric acid called 
butyrate dope. This mixture protected the fabric from dirt 
and moisture, but it did not adhere as well to the fabric as 
nitrate dope. Eventually, a system combining the two dope 
coatings was developed. First, the fabric was coated with 
nitrate dope for its adhesion and protective qualities. Then, 
subsequent coats of butyrate dope were added. Since the 
butyrate dope coatings reduced the overall flammability of 
the fabric covering, this system became the standard fabric 
treatment system.

The second problem, lack of durability, stems from the 
eventual deterioration of fabric from exposure to the elements 
that results in a limited service life. Although the mixture of 
nitrate dope and butyrate dope kept out dirt and water, solving 
some of the degradation issue, it did not address deterioration 
caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Ultraviolet 
radiation passed through the dope and degraded not only the 
fabric, but also the aircraft structure underneath. Attempts to 
paint the coated fabric proved unsuccessful, because paint 
does not adhere well to nitrate dope. Eventually, aluminum 
solids were added to the butyrate coatings. This mixture 
reflected the sun’s rays, prevented harmful UV rays from 
penetrating the dope, and protected the fabric, as well as the 
aircraft structure. 
 
Regardless of treatments, organic fabrics have a limited 
lifespan; cotton or linen covering on an actively flown aircraft 
lasts only about 5–10 years. Furthermore, aircraft cotton has 
not been available for over 25 years. As the aviation industry 
developed more powerful engines and more aerodynamic 
aircraft structures, aluminum became the material of 
choice. Its use in engines, aircraft frames, and coverings 
revolutionized aviation. As a covering, aluminum protected 
the aircraft structure from the elements, was durable, and 
was not flammable. 

Although aluminum and composite aircraft dominate modern 
aviation, advances in fabric coverings continue to be made 
because gliders, home-built, and light sport aircraft, as well 
as some standard and utility certificated aircraft, are still  

produced with fabric coverings. [Figure 3-1] The nitrate/
butyrate dope process works well, but does not mitigate 
the short lifespan of organic fabrics. It was not until the 
introduction of polyester fabric as an aircraft covering in 
the 1950s that the problem of the limited lifespan of fabric 
covering was solved. The transition to polyester fabric had 
some problems because the nitrate and butyrate dope coating 
process is not as suitable for polyester as it is for organic 
fabrics. Upon initial application of the dopes to polyester, 
good adhesion and protection occurred; as the dopes dried, 
they would eventually separate from the fabric. In other 
words, the fabric outlasted the coating. 

Eventually, dope additives were developed that minimized 
the separation problem. For example, plasticizers keep the 
dried dope flexible and nontautening dope formulas eliminate 
separation of the coatings from the fabric. Properly protected 
and coated, polyester lasts indefinitely and is stronger 
than cotton or linen. Today, polyester fabric coverings are 
the standard and use of cotton and linen on United States 
certificated aircraft has ceased. In fact, the long staple cotton 
from which grade-A cotton aircraft fabric is made is no longer 
produced in this country. 

Re-covering existing fabric aircraft is an accepted maintenance 
procedure. Not all aircraft covering systems include the use 
of dope coating processes. Modern aircraft covering systems 
that include the use of nondope fabric treatments show no 
signs of deterioration even after decades of service. In this

as well as basic covering techniques.

Fabric Terms
To facilitate the discussion of fabric coverings for aircraft, 
the following definitions are presented. Figure 3-2 illustrates 
some of these items.

• Warp—the direction along the length of fabric.

• Fill or weave—the direction across the width of the 
fabric.

• Count—the number of threads per inch in warp or 
filling.

• Ply—the number of yarns making up a thread.

• Bias—a cut, fold, or seam made diagonally to the warp 
or fill threads.

• Pinked edge—an edge which has been cut by machine 
or special pinking shears in a continuous series of Vs 
to prevent raveling. 

• Selvage edge—the edge of cloth, tape, or webbing 
woven to prevent raveling.

• Greige—condition of polyester fabric upon completion 
of the production process before being heat shrunk.

• Cross-coat—brushing or spraying where the second 
coat is applied 90° to the direction the first coat was 
applied. The two coats together make a single cross 
coat. [Figure 3-3]

Legal Aspects of Fabric Covering
When a fabric-covered aircraft is certificated, the aircraft 
manufacturer uses materials and techniques to cover the 
aircraft that are approved under the type certificate issued 
for that aircraft. The same materials and techniques must be 
used by maintenance personnel when replacing the aircraft 
fabric. Descriptions of these materials and techniques are 

in the manufacturer’s service manual. For example, aircraft 
originally manufactured with cotton fabric can only be 
re-covered with cotton fabric unless the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) approves an exception. Approved 
exceptions for alternate fabric-covering materials and 
procedures are common. Since polyester fabric coverings 
deliver performance advantages, such as lighter weight, 
longer life, additional strength, and lower cost, many older 
aircraft originally manufactured with cotton fabric have 
received approved alteration authority and have been re-
covered with polyester fabric. 


3-4

There are three ways to gain FAA approval to re-cover an 
aircraft with materials and processes other than those with 
which it was originally certificated. One is to do the work in 
accordance with an approved supplemental type certificate 
(STC). The STC must specify that it is for the particular 
aircraft model in question. It states in detail exactly what 
alternate materials must be used and what procedure(s) must 
be followed. Deviation from the STC data in any way renders 
the aircraft unairworthy. The holder of the STC typically sells 
the materials and the use of the STC to the person wishing 
to re-cover the aircraft. 

The second way to gain approval to re-cover an aircraft with 
different materials and processes is with a field approval. A 
field approval is a one-time approval issued by the FAA Flight 
Standards District Office (FSDO) permitting the materials 
and procedures requested to replace those of the original 
manufacturer. A field approval request is made on FAA Form 
337. A thorough description of the materials and processes 
must be submitted with proof that, when the alteration is 
completed, the aircraft meets or exceeds the performance 
parameters set forth by the original type certificate. 

The third way is for a manufacturer to secure approval 
through the Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) for a new 
process. For example, Piper Aircraft Co. originally covered 
their PA-18s in cotton. Later, they secured approval to 
recover their aircraft with Dacron fabric. Recovering an older 
PA-18 with Dacron in accordance with the TCDS would be 
a major repair, but not an alteration as the TCDS holder has 
current approval for the fabric. 

Advisory Circular (AC) 43.13-1, Acceptable Methods, 
Techniques, and Practices—Aircraft Inspection and Repair, 
contains acceptable practices for covering aircraft with fabric. 
It is a valuable source of general and specific information on 
fabric and fabric repair that can be used on Form 337 to justify 
procedures requested for a field approval. Submitting an FAA 
Form 337 does not guarantee a requested field approval. The 
FSDO inspector considers all aspects of the procedures and 
their effect(s) on the aircraft for which the request is being 
filed. Additional data may be required for approval. 

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 
43, Appendix A, states which maintenance actions are 
considered major repairs and which actions are considered 
major alterations. Fabric re-covering is considered a major 
repair and FAA Form 337 is executed whenever an aircraft is 
re-covered with fabric. Appendix A also states that changing 
parts of an aircraft wing, tail surface, or fuselage when not 
listed in the aircraft specifications issued by the FAA is a 
major alteration. This means that replacing cotton fabric with 
polyester fabric is a major alteration. A properly executed 

FAA Form 337 also needs to be approved in order for this 
alteration to be legal. 

FAA Form 337, which satisfies the documentation requirements 
for major fabric repairs and alterations, requires participation of 
an FAA-certificated Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) mechanic 
with an Inspection Authorization (IA) in the re-covering 
process. Often the work involved in re-covering a fabric aircraft 
is performed by someone else, but under the supervision of the 
IA (IA certification requires A&P certification). This typically 
means the IA inspects the aircraft structure and the re-cover job 
at various stages to be sure STC or field approval specifications 
are being followed. The signatures of the IA and the FSDO 
inspector are required on the approved FAA Form 337. The 
aircraft logbook also must be signed by the FAA-certificated 
A&P mechanic. It is important to contact the local FSDO before 
making any major repair or alteration. 

Approved Materials 
There are a variety of approved materials used in aircraft 
fabric covering and repair processes. In order for the items 
to legally be used, the FAA must approve the fabric, tapes, 
threads, cords, glues, dopes, sealants, coatings, thinners, 
additives, fungicides, rejuvenators, and paints for the 
manufacturer, the holder of an STC, or a field approval.

Fabric 
A Technical Standard Order (TSO) is a minimum performance 
standard issued by the FAA for specified materials, parts, 
processes, and appliances used on civil aircraft. For example, 
TSO-C15d, Aircraft Fabric, Grade A, prescribes the minimum 
performance standards that approved aircraft fabric must 
meet. Fabric that meets or exceeds the TSO can be used as a 
covering. Fabric approved to replace Grade-A cotton, such as 
polyester, must meet the same criteria. TSO-C15d also refers 
to another document, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
Aerospace Material Specification (AMS) 3806D, which details 
properties a fabric must contain to be an approved fabric for 
airplane cloth. Lighter weight fabrics typically adhere to the 
specifications in TSO-C14b, which refers to SAE AMS 3804C. 

When a company is approved to manufacture or sell an 
approved aviation fabric, it applies for and receives a Parts 
Manufacturing Approval (PMA). Currently, only a few 
approved fabrics are used for aircraft coverings, such as 
the polyester fabrics Ceconite™, Stits/Polyfiber™, and 
Superflite™. These fabrics and some of their characteristics 
are shown in Figure 3-4. The holders of the PMA for these 
fabrics have also developed and gained approval for the 
various tapes, chords, threads, and liquids that are used 
in the covering process. These approved materials, along 
with the procedures for using them, constitute the STCs for 
each particular fabric covering process. Only the approved

materials can be used. Substitution of other materials is 
forbidden and results in the aircraft being unairworthy.
 
Other Fabric Covering Materials
The following is an introduction to the supplemental materials 
used to complete a fabric covering job per manufacturer’s 
instruction or a STC.

Anti-Chafe Tape
Anti-chafe tape is used on sharp protrusions, rib caps, metal 
seams, and other areas to provide a smoother surface to keep 
the fabric from being torn. It is usually self-adhesive cloth 
tape and is applied after the aircraft is cleaned, inspected, 
and primed, but before the fabric is installed.

Reinforcing Tape
Reinforcing tape is most commonly used on rib caps after 
the fabric covering is installed to protect and strengthen the 
area for attaching the fabric to the ribs.

Rib Bracing
Rib bracing tape is used on wing ribs before the fabric is 
installed. It is applied spanwise and alternately wrapped 
around a top rib cap and then a bottom rib cap progressing 
from rib to rib until all are braced. [Figure 3-5] Lacing 
the ribs in this manner holds them in the proper place and 
alignment during the covering process.

Surface Tape
Surface tape, made of polyester material and often pre-
shrunk, is obtained from the STC holder. This tape, also 
known as finishing tape, is applied after the fabric is installed. 
It is used over seams, ribs, patches, and edges. Surface tape 
can have straight or pinked edges and comes in various 
widths. For curved surfaces, bias cut tape is available, which 
allows the tape to be shaped around a radius. 

Rib Lacing Cord
Rib lacing cord is used to lace the fabric to the wing ribs. 
It must be strong and applied as directed to safely transfer 
in-flight loads from the fabric to the ribs. Rib lacing cord is

available in a round or flat cross-section. The round cord is 
easier to use than the flat lacing, but if installed properly, the 
flat lacing results in a smoother finish over the ribs.

Sewing Thread
Sewing of polyester fabric is rare and mostly limited to the 
creation of prefitted envelopes used in the envelope method 
covering process. When a fabric seam must be made with no 
structure underneath it, a sewn seam could be used. Polyester 
threads of various specifications are used on polyester fabric. 
Different thread is specified for hand sewing versus machine 
sewing. For hand sewing, the thread is typically a three-ply, 
uncoated polyester thread with a 15-pound tensile strength. 
Machine thread is typically four-ply polyester with a 10- 
pound tensile strength.

Special Fabric Fasteners
Each fabric covering job involves a method of attaching 
the fabric to wing and empennage ribs. The original 
manufacturer’s method of fastening should be used. In 
addition to lacing the fabric to the ribs with approved rib 
lacing cord, special clips, screws, and rivets are employed 
on some aircraft. [Figure 3-6] The first step in using any 
of these fasteners is to inspect the holes into which they fit. 
Worn holes may have to be enlarged or re-drilled according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use of approved fasteners 
is mandatory. Use of unapproved fasteners can render the 
covering job unairworthy if substituted. Screws and rivets 
often incorporate the use of a plastic or aluminum washer. 
All fasteners and rib lacing are covered with finishing tape 
once installed to provide a smooth finish and airflow.

Grommets
Grommets are used to create reinforced drain holes in the 
aircraft fabric. Usually made of aluminum or plastic, they 
are glued or doped into place on the fabric surface. Once 
secured, a hole is created in the fabric through the center of 
the grommet. Often, this is done with a hot soldering pencil 
that also heat seals the fabric edge to prevent raveling. 
Seaplane grommets have a shield over the drain hole to 
prevent splashed water from entering the interior of the 
covered structure and to assist in siphoning out any water 
from within. [Figure 3-7] Drain holes using these grommets 
must be made before the grommets are put in place. Note that 
some drain holes do not require grommets if they are made 
through two layers of fabric.

Inspection Rings
The structure underneath an aircraft covering must be 
inspected periodically. To facilitate this in fabric-covered 
aircraft, inspection rings are glued or doped to the fabric. 
They provide a stable rim around an area of fabric that can be 
cut to allow viewing of the structure underneath. The fabric

Figure 3-8. Inspection rings and an inspection cover. 

Figure 3-7. Plastic, aluminum, and seaplane grommets are used to 
reinforce drain holes in the fabric covering. 

remains uncut until an inspection is desired. The rings are 
typically plastic or aluminum with an approximately three-
inch inside diameter. Spring clip metal panel covers can be 
fitted to close the area once the fabric inside the inspection 
ring has been cut for access. [Figure 3-8] The location 
of the inspection rings are specified by the manufacturer. 
Additional rings are sometimes added to permit access to 
important areas that may not have been fitted originally with 
inspection access.

Primer
The airframe structure of a fabric covered aircraft must be 
cleaned, inspected, and prepared before the fabric covering 
process begins. The final preparation procedure involves 
priming the structure with a treatment that works with the 
adhesive and first coats of fabric sealant that are to be utilized. 
Each STC specifies which primers, or if a wood structure, 
which varnishes are suitable. Most often, two-part epoxy 
primers are used on metal structure and two-part epoxy 
varnishes are used on wood structure. Utilize the primer 
specified by the manufacturer’s or STC’s instructions.

Fabric Cement
Modern fabric covering systems utilize special fabric cement 
to attach the fabric to the airframe. There are various types of 
cement. [Figure 3-9] In addition to good adhesion qualities, 
flexibility, and long life, fabric cements must be compatible 
with the primer and the fabric sealer that are applied before 
and after the cement. 

Fabric Sealer
Fabric sealer surrounds the fibers in the fabric with a 
protective coating to provide adhesion and keep out dirt and 
moisture. The sealer is the first coat applied to the polyester 
fabric after it is attached to the airframe and heat shrunk to 
fit snugly. Dope-based fabric coating systems utilize non-
tautening nitrate dope as the primary fabric sealant. The 
application of tautening dope may cause the fabric to become 
too taut resulting in excess stress on the airframe that could 
damage it. Nondope coating systems use proprietary sealers 
that are also nontautening. [Figure 3-9] 

Fillers
After the fabric sealer is applied, a filler is used. It is sprayed 
on in a number of cross coats as required by the manufacturer 
or the fabric covering process STC. The filler contains 
solids or chemicals that are included to block UV light from 
reaching the fabric. Proper fill coating is critical because 
UV light is the single most destructive element that causes 
polyester fabric to deteriorate. Dope-based processes use 
butyrate dope fillers while other processes have their own 
proprietary formulas. When fillers and sealers are combined, 
they are known as fabric primers. Aluminum pastes and 
powders, formerly added to butyrate dope to provide the 
UV protection, have been replaced by premixed formulas.

Topcoats
Once the aircraft fabric has been installed, sealed, and fill-
coat protected, finishing or topcoats are applied to give 
the aircraft its final appearance. Colored butyrate dope is 
common in dope-based processes, but various polyurethane 
topcoats are also available. It is important to use the topcoat 
products and procedures specified in the applicable STC to 
complete an airworthy fabric re-covering job.

The use of various additives is common at different stages 
when utilizing the above products. The following is a short 
list of additional products that facilitate the proper application 
of the fabric coatings. Note again that only products approved 
under a particular STC can be used. Substitution of similar 
products, even though they perform the same basic function, 
is not allowed.

• A catalyst accelerates a chemical reaction. Catalysts 
are specifically designed for each product with which 
they are mixed. They are commonly used with epoxies 
and polyurethanes. 

• A thinner is a solvent or mixture of solvents added 
to a product to give it the proper consistency for 
application, such as when spraying or brushing.

APPROVED PROPRIETARY PRODUCT NAME

• A retarder is added to a product to slow drying time. 
Used mostly in dope processes and topcoats, a retarder 
allow more time for a sprayed coating to flow and 
level, resulting in a deeper, glossier finish. It is used 
when the working temperature is elevated slightly 
above the ideal temperature for a product. It also can 
be used to prevent blushing of a dope finish when high 
humidity conditions exist.

• An accelerators contains solvents that speed up the 
drying time of the product with which it is mixed. 
It is typically used when the application working 
temperature is below that of the ideal working 
temperature. It can also be used for faster drying when 
airborne contaminants threaten a coating finish. 

• Rejuvenator, used on dope finishes only, contains 
solvents that soften coatings and allow them to flow 
slightly. Rejuvenator also contains fresh plasticizers 
that mix into the original coatings. This increases the 
overall flexibility and life of the coatings. 

• Fungicide and mildewicide additives are important 
for organic fabric covered aircraft because fabrics, 
such as cotton and linen, are hosts for fungus and 

mildew. Since fungus and mildew are not concerns 
when using polyester fabric, these additives are not 
required. Modern coating formulas contain premixed 
anti-fungal agents, providing sufficient insurance 
against the problem of fungus or mildew.

Available Covering Processes
The covering processes that utilize polyester fabric are the 
primary focus of this chapter. Examples of FAA-approved 
aircraft covering processes are listed in Figure 3-9. The 
processes can be distinguished by the chemical nature of the 
glue and coatings that are used. A dope-based covering process 
has been refined out of the cotton fabric era, with excellent 
results on polyester fabric. In particular, plasticizers added to 
the nitrate dope and butyrate dopes minimize the shrinking and 
tautening effects of the dope, establish flexibility, and allow 
esthetically pleasing tinted butyrate dope finishes that last 
indefinitely. Durable polyurethane-based processes integrate 
well with durable polyurethane topcoat finishes. Vinyl is the 
key ingredient in the popular Poly-Fiber covering system. Air 
Tech uses an acetone thinned polyurethane compatible system.


3-9

The most recent entry into the covering systems market is the 
Stewart Finishing System that uses waterborne technology 
to apply polyurethane coatings to the fabric. The glue used 
in the system is water-based and nonvolatile. The Stewart 
Finishing System is Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
compliant and STC approved. Both the Stewart and Air Tech 
systems operate with any of the approved polyester fabrics 
as stated in their covering system STCs. 

All the modern fabric covering systems listed in Figure 3-9 
result in a polyester fabric covered aircraft with an indefinite 
service life. Individual preferences exist for working with the 
different approved processes. A description of basic covering 
procedures and techniques common to most of these systems 
follows later in this chapter.

Ceconite™, Polyfiber™, and Superflight™ are STC-approved 
fabrics with processes used to install polyester fabric 
coverings. Two companies that do not manufacturer their own 
fabric have gained STC approval for covering accessories 
and procedures to be used with these approved fabrics. The 
STCs specify the fabrics and the proprietary materials that are 
required to legally complete the re-covering job. 

The aircraft fabric covering process is a three-step process. 
First, select an approved fabric. Second, follow the applicable 
STC steps to attach the fabric to the airframe and to protect it 
from the elements. Third, apply the approved topcoat to give 
the aircraft its color scheme and final appearance. 

Although Grade-A cotton can be used on all aircraft originally 
certificated to be covered with this material, approved 
aircraft cotton fabric is no longer available. Additionally, 
due to the shortcomings of cotton fabric coverings, most of 
these aircraft have been re-covered with polyester fabric. In 
the rare instance the technician encounters a cotton fabric 
covered aircraft that is still airworthy, inspection and repair 
procedures specified in AC 43.13-1, Chapter 2, Fabric 
Covering, should be followed.

Determining Fabric Condition—Repair or 
Recover?
Re-covering an aircraft with fabric is a major repair and 
should only be undertaken when necessary. Often a repair 
to the present fabric is sufficient to keep the aircraft 
airworthy. The original manufacturer’s recommendations 
or the covering process STC should be consulted for the 
type of repair required for the damage incurred by the fabric 
covering. AC 43.13-1 also gives guidelines and acceptable 
practices for repairing cotton fabric, specifically when 
stitching is concerned. 

Often a large area that needs repair is judged in reference to 
the overall remaining lifespan of the fabric on the aircraft. For 
example, if the fabric has reached the limit of its durability, it 
is better to re-cover the entire aircraft than to replace a large 
damaged area when the remainder of the aircraft would soon 
need to be re-covered.

On aircraft with dope-based covering systems, continued 
shrinkage of the dope can cause the fabric to become too tight. 
Overly tight fabric may require the aircraft to be re-covered 
rather than repaired because excess tension on fabric can 
cause airframe structural damage. Loose fabric flaps in the 
wind during flight, affecting weight distribution and unduly 
stressing the airframe. It may also need to be replaced because 
of damage to the airframe. 

Another reason to re-cover rather than repair occurs when 
dope coatings on fabric develop cracks. These cracks could 
expose the fabric beneath to the elements that can weaken 
it. Close observation and field testing must be used to 
determine if the fabrics are airworthy. If not, the aircraft 
must be re-covered. If the fabric is airworthy and no other 
problems exist, a rejuvenator can be used per manufacturer’s 
instructions. This product is usually sprayed on and softens 
the coatings with very powerful solvents. Plasticizers in the 
rejuvenator become part of the film that fills in the cracks. 
After the rejuvenator dries, additional coats of aluminum-
pigmented dope must be added and then final topcoats applied 
to finish the job. While laborious, rejuvenating a dope finish 
over strong fabric can save a great deal of time and money. 
Polyurethane-based finishes cannot be rejuvenated.

Fabric Strength
Deterioration of the strength of the present fabric covering is 
the most common reason to re-cover an aircraft. The strength 
of fabric coverings must be determined at every 100-hour 
and annual inspection. Minimum fabric breaking strength is 
used to determine if an aircraft requires re-covering. 

Fabric strength is a major factor in the airworthiness of 
an aircraft. Fabric is considered to be airworthy until it 
deteriorates to a breaking strength less than 70 percent of 
the strength of the new fabric required for the aircraft. For 
example, if an aircraft was certificated with Grade-A cotton 
fabric that has a new breaking strength of 80 pounds, it 
becomes unairworthy when the fabric strength falls to 56 
pounds, which is 70 percent of 80 pounds. If polyester fabric, 
which has a higher new breaking strength, is used to re-cover 
this same aircraft, it would also need to exceed 56 pounds 
breaking strength to remain airworthy.

Figure 3-10. Aircraft performance affects fabric selection.

In general, an aircraft is certified with a certain fabric based 
on its wing loading and its never exceed speed (VNE). The 
higher the wing loading and VNE, the stronger the fabric must 
be. On aircraft with wing loading of 9 pounds per square foot 
and over, or a VNE of 160 miles per hour (mph) or higher, 
fabric equaling or exceeding the strength of Grade A cotton is 
required. This means the new fabric breaking strength must be 
at least 80 pounds and the minimum fabric breaking strength 
at which the aircraft becomes unairworthy is 56 pounds.

On aircraft with wing loading of 9 pounds per square foot or 
less, or a VNE of 160 mph or less, fabric equaling or exceeding 
the strength of intermediate grade cotton is required. This 
means the new fabric breaking strength must be at least 65 
pounds and the minimum fabric breaking strength at which 
the aircraft becomes unairworthy is 46 pounds.

Lighter weight fabric may be found to have been certified on 
gliders or sailplanes and may be used on many uncertificated 
aircraft or aircraft in the Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) category. 
For aircraft with wing loading less than 8 pounds per square 
foot or less, or VNE of 135 mph or less, the fabric is considered 
unairworthy when the breaking strength has deteriorated to 
below 35 pounds (new minimum strength of 50 pounds). 
Figure 3-10 summarizes these parameters.

How Fabric Breaking Strength is Determined
Manufacturer’s instructions should always be consulted 
first for fabric strength inspection methodology. These 
instructions are approved data and may not require removal 
of a test strip to determine airworthiness of the fabric. In some 
cases, the manufacturer’s information does not include any 
fabric inspection methods. It may refer the IA to AC 43.13-
1, Chapter 2, Fabric Covering, which contains the approved 
FAA test strip method for breaking strength. 

The test strip method for the breaking strength of aircraft 
covering fabrics uses standards published by the American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for the testing 
of various materials. Breaking strength is determined by 
cutting a 1¼ inch by 4–6 inch strip of fabric from the aircraft 

covering. This sample should be taken from an area that is 
exposed to the elements—usually an upper surface. It is also 
wise to take the sample from an area that has a dark colored 
finish since this has absorbed more of the sun’s UV rays 
and degraded faster. All coatings are then removed and the 
edges raveled to leave a 1-inch width. One end of the strip is 
clamped into a secured clamp and the other end is clamped 
such that a suitable container may be suspended from it. 
Weight is added to the container until the fabric breaks. The 
breaking strength of the fabric is equal to the weight of the 
lower clamp, the container, and the weight added to it. If the 
breaking strength is still in question, a sample should be sent 
to a qualified testing laboratory and breaking strength tests 
made in accordance with ASTM publication D5035. 

Note that the fabric test strip must have all coatings removed 
from it for the test. Soaking and cleaning the test strip in 
methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) usually removes all the coatings. 

Properly installed and maintained polyester fabric should 
give years of service before appreciable fabric strength 
degradation occurs. Aircraft owners often prefer not to 
have test strips cut out of the fabric, especially when the 
aircraft or the fabric covering is relatively new, because 
removal of a test strip damages the integrity of an airworthy 
component if the fabric passes. The test strip area then must 
be repaired, costing time and money. To avoid cutting a 
strip out of airworthy fabric, the IA makes a decision based 
on knowledge, experience, and available nondestructive 
techniques as to whether removal of a test strip is warranted 
to ensure that the aircraft can be returned to service.

An aircraft made airworthy under an STC is subject to the 
instructions for continued airworthiness in that STC. Most 
STCs refer to AC 43.13-1 for inspection methodology. Poly-
Fiber™ and Ceconite™ re-covering process STCs contain their 
own instructions and techniques for determining fabric strength 
and airworthiness. Therefore, an aircraft covered under those 
STCs may be inspected in accordance with this information. 
In most cases, the aircraft can be approved for return to service 
without cutting a strip from the fabric covering.

The procedures in the Poly-Fiber™ and Ceconite™ STCs 
outlined in the following paragraphs are useful when inspecting 
any fabric covered aircraft as they add to the information 
gathered by the IA to determine the condition of the fabric. 
However, following these procedures alone on aircraft not re-
covered under these STCs does not make the aircraft airworthy. 
The IA must add his or her own knowledge, experience, and 
judgment to make a final determination of the strength of the 
fabric and whether it is airworthy.

Exposure to UV radiation appreciably reduces the strength of 
polyester fabric and forms the basis of the Poly-Fiber™ and 
Ceconite™ fabric evaluation process. All approved covering 
systems utilize fill coats applied to the fabric to protect it 
from UV. If installed according to the STC, these coatings 
should be sufficient to protect the fabric from the sun and 
should last indefinitely. Therefore, most of the evaluation 
of the strength of the fabric is actually an evaluation of the 
condition of its protective coating(s).

Upon a close visual inspection, the fabric coating(s) should 
be consistent, contain no cracks, and be flexible, not brittle. 
Pushing hard against the fabric with a knuckle should not 
damage the coating(s). It is recommended the inspector 
check in several areas, especially those most exposed to the 
sun. Coatings that pass this test can move to a simple test 
that determines whether or not UV light is passing through 
the coatings.

This test is based on the assumption that if visible light 
passes through the fabric coatings, then UV light can also. To 
verify whether or not visible light passes through the fabric 
coating, remove an inspection panel from the wing, fuselage, 
or empennage. Have someone hold an illuminated 60-watt 
lamp one foot away from the exterior of the fabric. No light 
should be visible through the fabric. If no light is visible, the 
fabric has not been weakened by UV rays and can be assumed 
to be airworthy. There is no need to perform the fabric strip 
strength test. If light is visible through the coatings, further 
investigation is required.

Fabric Testing Devices
Mechanical devices used to test fabric by pressing against 
or piercing the finished fabric are not FAA approved and 
are used at the discretion of the FAA-certificated mechanic 
to form an opinion on the general fabric condition. Punch 
test accuracy depends on the individual device calibration, 
total coating thickness, brittleness, and types of coatings 
and fabric. If the fabric tests in the lower breaking strength 
range with the mechanical punch tester or if the overall 
fabric cover conditions are poor, then more accurate field 
tests may be made.

The test should be performed on exposed fabric where there 
is a crack or chip in the coatings. If there is no crack or chip, 
coatings should be removed to expose the fabric wherever 
the test is to be done. 

The Maule punch tester, a spring-loaded device with its 
scale calibrated in breaking strength, tests fabric strength 
by pressing against it while the fabric is still on the aircraft. 
It roughly equates strength in pounds per square inch (psi) 
of resistance to breaking strength. The tester is pushed 
squarely against the fabric until the scale reads the amount 
of maximum allowable degradation. If the tester does 
not puncture the fabric, it may be considered airworthy. 
Punctures near the breaking strength should be followed 
with further testing, specifically the strip breaking strength 
test described above. Usually, a puncture indicates the fabric 
is in need of replacement.

A second type of punch tester, the Seyboth, is not as popular 
as the Maule because it punctures a small hole in the fabric 
when the mechanic pushes the shoulder of the testing unit 
against the fabric. A pin with a color-coded calibrated scale 
protrudes from the top of the tester and the mechanic reads 
this scale to determine fabric strength. Since this device 
requires a repair regardless of the strength of the fabric 
indicated, it is not widely used. 

Seyboth and Maule fabric strength testers designed for 
cotton- and linen-covered aircraft, not to be used on modern 
Dacron fabrics. Mechanical devices, combined with other 
information and experience, help the FAA-certificated 
mechanic judge the strength of the fabric. [Figure 3-11]

General Fabric Covering Process
It is required to have an IA involved in the process of re-
covering a fabric aircraft because re-covering is a major repair 
or major alteration. Signatures are required on FAA Form 
337 and in the aircraft logbook. To ensure work progresses 
as required, the IA should be involved from the beginning, 
as well as at various stages throughout the process. 

This section describes steps common to various STC and 
manufacturer covering processes, as well as the differences 
of some processes. To aid in proper performance of fabric 
covering and repair procedures, STC holders produce 
illustrated, step-by-step instructional manuals and videos that 
demonstrate the correct covering procedures. These training 
aids are invaluable to the inexperienced technician.

Since modern fabric coverings last indefinitely, a rare 
opportunity to inspect the aircraft exists during the re-
covering process. Inspectors and owner-operators should 
use this opportunity to perform a thorough inspection of the 
aircraft before new fabric is installed.

The method of fabric attachment should be identical, as far as 
strength and reliability are concerned, to the method used by 
the manufacturer of the aircraft being recovered or repaired. 
Carefully remove the old fabric from the airframe, noting the 
location of inspection covers, drain grommets, and method 
of attachment. Either the envelope method or blanket method 
of fabric covering is acceptable, but a choice must be made 
prior to beginning the re-covering process. 

Blanket Method vs. Envelope Method 
In the blanket method of re-covering, multiple flat sections 
of fabric are trimmed and attached to the airframe. Certified 
greige polyester fabric for covering an aircraft can be up to 
70 inches in width and used as it comes off the bolt. Each 
aircraft must be considered individually to determine the 
size and layout of blankets needed to cover it. A single 
blanket cut for each small surface (i.e., stabilizers and control 
surfaces) is common. Wings may require two blankets that 
overlap. Fuselages are covered with multiple blankets that 
span between major structural members, often with a single 
blanket for the bottom. Very large wings may require more 
than two blankets of fabric to cover the entire top and bottom 
surfaces. In all cases, the fabric is adhered to the airframe 
using the approved adhesives, following specific rules for the 
covering process being employed. [Figure 3-12]

An alternative method of re-covering, the envelope method, 
saves time by using precut and pre-sewn envelopes of fabric to 
cover the aircraft. The envelopes must be sewn with approved 
machine sewing thread, edge distance, fabric fold, etc., such 
as those specified in AC 43.13-1 or an STC. Patterns are 

made and fabric is cut and stitched so that each major surface, 
including the fuselage and wings, can be covered with a single, 
close-fitting envelope. Since envelopes are cut to fit, they are 
slid into position, oriented with the seams in the proper place, 
and attached with adhesive to the airframe. Envelope seams 
are usually located over airframe structure in inconspicuous 
places, such as the trailing edge structures and the very top and 
bottom of the fuselage, depending on airframe construction. 
Follow the manufacturer’s or STC’s instructions for proper 
location of the sewn seams of the envelope when using this 
method. [Figure 3-13]

Preparation for Fabric Covering Work
Proper preparation for re-covering a fabric aircraft is 
essential. First, assemble the materials and tools required to 
complete the job. The holder of the STC usually supplies a 
materials and tools list either separately or in the STC manual. 
Control of temperature, humidity, and ventilation is needed 
in the work environment. If ideal environmental conditions 
cannot be met, additives are available that compensate for 
this for most re-covering products.

Figure 3-15. Some components of a work area for covering an aircraft with fabric.

Figure 3-14. Rotating stands and sawhorses facilitate easy access to top and bottom surfaces during the fabric covering process. 

Rotating work stands for the fuselage and wings provide 
easy, alternating access to the upper and lower surfaces 
while the job is in progress. [Figure 3-14] They can be 
used with sawhorses or sawhorses can be used alone to 
support the aircraft structure while working. A workbench 
or table, as well as a rolling cart and storage cabinet, are also 
recommended. Figure 3-15 shows a well conceived fabric 
covering workshop. A paint spray booth for sprayed-on 
coatings and space to store components awaiting work is 
also recommended. 

Many of the substances used in most re-covering processes 
are highly toxic. Proper protection must be used to avoid 
serious short- and long-term adverse health effects. Eye 

protection, a proper respirator, and skin protection are 
vital. As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, nitrate 
dope is very flammable. Proper ventilation and a rated fire 
extinguisher should be on hand when working with this and 
other covering process materials. Grounding of work to 
prevent static electricity build-up may be required. All fabric 
re-covering processes also involve multiple coats of various 
products that are sprayed onto the fabric surface. Use of a 
high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) sprayer is recommended. 
Good ventilation is needed for all of the processes.

Gently roll the fabric back as the cut is made.

Carefully cut away the fabric.

Figure 3-16. Old fabric coverings are cut off in large pieces to preserve them as templates for locating various airframe features. Sharp 
blades and care must be used to avoid damaging the structure.

Removal of Old Fabric Coverings
Removal of the old covering is the first step in replacing 
an aircraft fabric covering. Cut away the old fabric from 
the airframe with razor blades or utility knife. Care should 
be taken to ensure that no damage is done to the airframe. 
[Figure 3-16] To use the old covering for templates in 
transferring the location of inspection panels, cable guides, 
and other features to the new covering, the old covering 
should be removed in large sections. NOTE: any rib stitching 
fasteners, if used to attach the fabric to the structure, should 
be removed before the fabric is pulled free of the airframe. If 
fasteners are left in place, damage to the structure may occur 
during fabric removal. 

Preparation of the Airframe Before Covering
Once the old fabric has been removed, the exposed airframe 
structure must be thoroughly cleaned and inspected. The 
IA collaborating on the job should be involved in this step 
of the process. Details of the inspection should follow the 
manufacturer’s guidelines, the STC, or AC 43.13-1. All 
of the old adhesive must be completely removed from the 
airframe with solvent, such as MEK. A thorough inspection 
must be done and various components may be selected to be 
removed for cleaning, inspection, and testing. Any repairs 
that are required, including the removal and treatment of all 
corrosion, must be done at this time. If the airframe is steel 

tubing, many technicians take the opportunity to grit blast 
the entire airframe at this stage.

The leading edge of a wing is a critical area where airflow 
diverges and begins its laminar flow over the wing’s surfaces, 
which results in the generation of lift. It is beneficial to have 
a smooth, regular surface in this area. Plywood leading edges 
must be sanded until smooth, bare wood is exposed. If oil 
or grease spots exist, they must be cleaned with naphtha or 
other specified cleaners. If there are any chips, indentations, 
or irregularities, approved filler may be spread into these 
areas and sanded smooth. The entire leading edge should be 
cleaned before beginning the fabric covering process. 

To obtain a smooth finish on fabric-covered leading edges 
of aluminum wings, a sheet of felt or polyester padding may 
be applied before the fabric is installed. This should only be 
done with the material specified in the STC under which 
the technician is working. The approved padding ensures 
compatibility with the adhesives and first coatings of the 
covering process. When a leading edge pad is used, check the 
STC process instructions for permission to make a cemented 
fabric seam over the padding. [Figure 3-17]

When completely cleaned, inspected, and repaired, an 
approved primer, or varnish if it is a wood structure, should 
be applied to the airframe. This step is sometimes referred

to as dope proofing. Exposed aluminum must first be acid 
etched. Use the product(s) specified by the manufacturer 
or in the STC to prepare the metal before priming. Two 
part epoxy primers and varnishes, which are not affected 
by the fabric adhesive and subsequent coatings, are usually 
specified. One part primers, such as zinc chromate and spar 
varnish, are typically not acceptable. The chemicals in the 
adhesives dissolve the primers, and adhesion of the fabric 
to the airframe is lost. 
 
Sharp edges, metal seams, the heads of rivets, and any 
other feature on the aircraft structure that might cut or wear 
through the fabric should be covered with anti-chafe tape. As  
described above, this cloth sticky-back tape is approved and 
should not be substituted with masking or any other kind of 
tape. Sometimes, rib cap strips need to have anti-chafe tape 
applied when the edges are not rounded over. [Figure 3-18]

Inter-rib bracing must also be accomplished before the fabric 
is installed. It normally does not have an adhesive attached to 
it and is wrapped only once around each rib. The single wrap 
around each rib is enough to hold the ribs in place during 
the covering process but allows small movements during the 
fabric shrinking process. [Figure 3-19]

Attaching Polyester Fabric to the Airframe
Inexperienced technicians are encouraged to construct a 
test panel upon which they can practice with the fabric and 
various substances and techniques to be used on the aircraft. 
It is often suggested to cover smaller surfaces first, such as 
the empennage and control surfaces. Mistakes on these can 
be corrected and are less costly if they occur. The techniques 
employed for all surfaces, including the wings and fuselage, 
are basically the same. Once dexterity has been established, 
the order in which one proceeds is often a personal choice.

When the airframe is primed and ready for fabric installation, 
it must receive a final inspection by an A&P with IA.  
When approved, attachment of the fabric may begin. The 
manufacturer’s or STC’s instructions must be followed 
without deviation for the job to be airworthy. The following 
are the general steps taken. Each approved process has its 
own nuances. 

Seams
During installation, the fabric is overlapped and seamed 
together. Primary concerns for fabric seams are strength, 
elasticity, durability, and good appearance. Whether using the 
blanket method or envelope method, position all fabric seams 
over airframe structure to which the fabric is to be adhered 
during the covering process, whenever possible. Unlike the 
blanket method, fabric seam overlap is predetermined in the 
envelope method. Seams sewn to the specifications in AC 
43.13-1, the STC under which the work is being performed, 
or the manufacturer’s instructions should perform adequately. 

Most covering procedures for polyester fabric rely on doped 
or glued seams as opposed to sewn seams. They are simple 
and easy to make and provide excellent strength, elasticity, 
durability, and appearance. When using the blanket method, 
seam overlap is specified in the covering instructions and 
the FAA-certificated A&P mechanic must adhere to these 
specifications. Typically, a minimum of two to four inches 
of fabric overlap seam is required where ends of fabric are 
joined in areas of critical airflow, such as the leading edge of 
a wing. One to two inches of overlap is often the minimum 
in other areas. 

When using the blanket method, options exist for deciding 
where to overlap the fabric for coverage. Function and the 
final appearance of the covering job should be considered. 
For example, fabric seams made on the wing’s top surface 
of a high wing aircraft are not visible when approaching the 
aircraft. Seams on low wing aircraft and many horizontal 
stabilizers are usually made on the bottom of the wing for 
the same reason. [Figure 3-20]

Fabric Cement
A polyester fabric covering is cemented or glued to the 
airframe structure at all points where it makes contact. Special 
formula adhesives have replaced nitrate dope for adhesion 
in most covering processes. The adhesive (as well as all 
subsequent coating materials) should be mixed for optimum 
characteristics at the temperature at which the work is being 
performed. Follow the manufacturer’s or STC’s guidance 
when mixing.

Figure 3-22. An example of a wing fabric ironing procedure designed to evenly taughten the fabric.

Figure 3-21. Irons used during the fabric covering process. 

To attach the fabric to the airframe, first pre-apply two 
coats of adhesive to the structure at all points the fabric is 
to contact it. (It is important to follow the manufacturer’s or 
STC’s guidance as all systems are different.) Allow these to 
dry. The fabric is then spread over the surface and clamped 
into position. It should not be pulled tighter than the relaxed 
but not wrinkled condition it assumes when lying on the 
structure. Clamps or clothespins are used to attach the fabric 
completely around the perimeter. The Stewart System STC 
does not need clamps because the glue assumes a tacky 
condition when precoated and dried. There is sufficient 
adhesion in the precoat to position the fabric. 

The fabric should be positioned in all areas before undertaking 
final adhesion. Final adhesion often involves lifting the  
fabric, applying a wet bed of cement, and pressing the fabric 
into the bed. An additional coat of cement over the top of 
the fabric is common. Depending on the process, wrinkles 
and excess cement are smoothed out with a squeegee or are 
ironed out. The Stewart System calls for heat activation of 
the cement precoats through the fabric with an iron while 
the fabric is in place. Follow the approved instructions for 
the covering method being used.

Fabric Heat Shrinking
Once the fabric has been glued to the structure, it can be 
made taut by heat shrinking. This process is done with an 
ordinary household iron that the technician calibrates before 
use. A smaller iron is also used to iron in small or tight places. 
[Figure 3-21] The iron is run over the entire surface of the 
fabric. Follow the instructions for the work being performed. 

Some processes avoid ironing seams while other processes 
begin ironing over structure and move to spanned fabric or 
vice-versa. It is important to shrink the fabric evenly. Starting 
on one end of a structure and progressing sequentially to the 
other end is not recommended. Skipping from one end to the 
other, and then to the middle, is more likely to evenly draw 
the fabric tight. [Figure 3-22]


3-18

Figure 3-24. A premarked location for a lacing hole, which is 
punched through the fabric with a pencil. 

Figure 3-23. Reinforcing tape the same width as the wing ribs is 
applied over all wing ribs.

The amount polyester fabric shrinks is directly related to 
the temperature applied. Polyester fabric can shrink nearly 
5 percent at 250 °F and 10 percent at 350 °F. It is customary 
to shrink the fabric in stages, using a lower temperature first, 
before finishing with the final temperature setting. The first 
shrinking is used to remove wrinkles and excess fabric. The 
final shrinking gives the finished tautness desired. Each 
process has its own temperature regime for the stages of 
tautening. Typically ranging from 225 °F to 350 °F, it is 
imperative to follow the process instructions. Not all fabric 
covering processes use the same temperature range and 
maximum temperature. Ensure irons are calibrated to prevent 
damage at high temperature settings.

Attaching Fabric to the Wing Ribs
Once the fabric has been tautened, covering processes vary. 
Some require a sealing coat be applied to the fabric at this 
point. It is usually put on by brush to ensure the fibers are 
saturated. Other processes seal the fabric later. Whatever 
the process, the fabric on wings must be secured to the wing 
ribs with more than just cement. The forces caused by the 
airflow over the wings are too great for cement alone to hold 
the fabric in place. As described in the materials section, 
screws, rivets, clips and lacing hold the fabric in place on 
manufactured aircraft. Use the same attach method as used by 
the original aircraft manufacturer. Deviation requires a field 
approval. Note that fuselage and empennage attachments 
may be used on some aircraft. Follow the methodology for 
wing rib lacing described below and the manufacturer’s 
instructions for attach point locations and any possible 
variations to what is presented here.

Care must always be taken to identify and eliminate any sharp 
edges that might wear through the fabric. Reinforcing tape of 
the exact same width as the rib cap is installed before any of 

the fasteners. This approved sticky-back tape helps prevent 
the fabric from tearing. [Figure 3-23] Then, screws, rivets, 
and clips simply attach into the predrilled holes in the rib caps 
to hold the fabric to the caps. Rib lacing is a more involved 
process whereby the fabric is attached to the ribs with cord.

Rib Lacing
There are two kinds of rib lacing cord. One has a round 
cross-section and the other flat. Which to use is a matter 
of preference based on ease of use and final appearance. 
Only approved rib lacing cord can be used. Unless a rib is 
unusually deep from top to bottom, rib lacing uses a single 
length of cord that passes completely through the wing from 
the upper surface to the lower surface thereby attaching the 
top and bottom skin to the rib simultaneously. 

Holes are laid out and pre-punched through the skin as 
close to the rib caps as possible to accept the lacing cord. 
[Figure 3-24] This minimizes leverage the fabric could 
develop while trying to pull away from the structure and 
prevents tearing. The location of the holes is not arbitrary. 
The spacing between lacing holes and knots must adhere 
to manufacturer’s instructions, if available. STC lacing 
guidance refers to manufacturer’s instructions or to that 
shown on the chart in Figure 3-25 which is taken from AC 
43.13-1. Notice that because of greater turbulence in the area 
of the propeller wash, closer spacing between the lacing is 
required there. This slipstream is considered to be the width 
of the propeller plus one additional rib. Ribs are normally 
laced from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wing. 
Rib lacing is done with a long curved needle to guide the 
cord in and out of holes and through the depth of the rib. 
The knots are designed not to slip under the forces applied 
and can be made in a series out of a single strand of lacing. 
Stitching can begin at the leading edge or trailing edge. A

Figure 3-25. A rib lacing spacing chart. Unless manufacturer data specifies otherwise, use the spacing indicated. 

square knot with a half hitch on each side is typically used 
for the first knot when lacing a rib. [Figure 3-26] This is 
followed by a series of modified seine knots until the final 
knot is made and secured with a half hitch. [Figure 3-27] 
Hidden modified seine knots are also used. These knots are 
placed below the fabric surface so only a single strand of 
lacing is visible across the rib cap. [Figure 3-28] 

Structure and accessories within the wing may prevent a 
continuous lacing. Ending the lacing and beginning again 
can avoid these obstacles. Lacing that is not long enough to 
complete the rib may be ended and a new starting knot can 
be initiated at the next set of holes. The lacing can also be 
extended by joining it with another piece of lacing using the 
splice knot shown in Figure 3-29.

knots are common. They are made so that the knots are pushed or pulled below the fabric surface.

Occasionally, lacing to just the rib cap is employed without 
lacing entirely through the wing and incorporating the cap on 
the opposite side. This is done where ribs are exceptionally 
deep or where through lacing is not possible, such as in an 
area where a fuel tank is installed. Changing to a needle with 
a tighter radius facilitates threading the lacing cord in these 
areas. Knotting procedures remain unchanged.

Figure 3-30. This inspection ring was cemented into place on the

overlay that is cemented over the ring and to the fabric. 

Technicians inexperienced at rib lacing should seek assistance 
to ensure the correct knots are being tied. STC holder videos 
are invaluable in this area. They present repeated close-up 
visual instruction and guidance to ensure airworthy lacing. 
AC 43.13-1, Chapter 2, Fabric Covering, also has in-depth 
instructions and diagrams as do some manufacturer’s manuals 
and STC’s instructions.

Rings, Grommets, and Gussets 
When the ribs are laced and the fabric covering completely 
attached, the various inspection rings, drain grommets, 
reinforcing patches, and finishing tapes are applied. Inspection 
rings aid access to critical areas of the structure (pulleys, bell 
cranks, drag/anti-drag wires, etc.) once the fabric skin is in 
place. They are plastic or aluminum and normally cemented 
to the fabric using the approved cement and procedures. The 
area inside the ring is left intact. It is removed only when 
inspection or maintenance requires access through that ring. 
Once removed, preformed inspection panels are used to close 
the opening. The rings should be positioned as specified by 
the manufacturer. Lacking that information, they should be 
positioned as they were on the previous covering fabric. 
Additional rings should be installed by the technician if it is 
determined a certain area would benefit from access in the 
future. [Figure 3-30]

Water from rain and condensation can collect under the fabric 
covering and needs a way to escape. Drain grommets serve 
this purpose. There are a few different types as described in 
the materials section above. All are cemented into position 
in accordance with the approved process under which the 
work is being performed. Locations for the drain grommets 
should be ascertained from manufacturer’s data. If not 
specified, AC 43.13-1 has acceptable location information. 
Each fabric covering STC may also give recommendations. 

Typically, drain grommets are located at the lowest part 
of each area of the structure (e.g., bottom of the fuselage, 
wings, empennage). [Figure 3-31] Each rib bay of the wings 
is usually drained with one or two grommets on the bottom 
of the trailing edge. Note that drain holes without grommets 
are sometimes approved in reinforced fabric. 

It is possible that additional inspection rings and drain 
grommets have been specified after the manufacture of the 

aircraft. Check the Airworthiness Directives (ADs) and 
Service Bulletins for the aircraft being re-covered to ensure 
required rings and grommets have been installed. 

Cable guide openings, strut-attach fitting areas, and similar 
features, as well as any protrusions in the fabric covering, are 
reinforced with fabric gussets. These are installed as patches 
in the desired location. They should be cut to fit exactly 
around the feature they reinforce to support the original 
opening made in the covering fabric. [Figure 3-32] Gussets 
made to keep protrusions from coming through the fabric 
should overlap the area they protect. Most processes call for 
the gusset material to be preshrunk and cemented into place 
using the approved covering process cementing procedures. 

Finishing Tapes
Finishing tapes are applied to all seams, edges, and over the 
ribs once all of the procedures above have been completed. 
They are used to protect these areas by providing smooth 
aerodynamic resistance to abrasion. The tapes are made from 
the same polyester material as the covering fabric. Use of 
lighter weight tapes is approved in some STCs. Preshrunk 
tapes are preferred because they react to exposure to the 
environment in the same way the as the fabric covering. 
This minimizes stress on the adhesive joint between the two.

installation over the fabric seam on a wing leading edge. Two-inch 
tapes cover the wing ribs and rib lacing.

gussets cemented in place. 

Straight edged and pinked tapes are available. The pinking 
provides greater surface area for adhesion of the edges and 
a smoother transition into the fabric covering. Only tapes 
approved in the STC under which work is being accomplished 
may be used to be considered airworthy. 

Finishing tapes from one to six inches in width are used. 
Typically, two inch tapes cover the rib lacing and fuselage 
seams. Wing leading edges usually receive the widest tape 
with four inches being common. [Figure 3-33] Bias cut tapes 
are often used to wrap around the curved surfaces of the 
airframe, such as the wing tips and empennage surface edges. 
They lay flat around the curves and do not require notching. 
Finishing tapes are attached with the process adhesive or 
the nitrate dope sealer when using a dope-based process. 
Generally, all chordwise tapes are applied first followed by 
the span-wise tapes at the leading and trailing edges. Follow 
the manufacturer’s STC or AC 43.13-1 instructions.
 
Coating the Fabric
The sealer coat in most fabric covering processes is applied 
after all finishing tapes have been installed unless it was 
applied prior to rib lacing as in a dope-based finishing 
process. This coat saturates and completely surrounds the 

fibers in the polyester fabric, forming a barrier that keeps 
water and contaminants from reaching the fabric during 
its life. It is also used to provide adhesion of subsequent 
coatings. Usually brushed on in a cross coat application for 
thorough penetration, two coats of sealer are commonly used 
but processes vary on how many coats and whether spray 
coating is permitted.

With the sealer coats installed and dried, the next step 
provides protection from UV light, the only significant cause 
of deterioration of polyester fabric. Designed to prevent UV 
light from reaching the fabric and extend the life of the fabric 
indefinitely, these coating products, or fill coats, contain 
aluminum solids premixed into them that block the UV rays. 
They are sprayed on in the number of cross coats as specified 
in the manufacturer’s STC or AC 43.13-1 instructions under 
which work is done. Two to four cross coats is common. 
Note that some processes may require coats of clear butyrate 
before the blocking formula is applied. 

Fabric primer is a coating used in some approved covering 
processes that combines the sealer and fill coatings into one. 
Applied to fabric after the finishing tapes are installed, these 
fabric primers surround and seal the fabric fibers, provide 
good adhesion for all of the following coatings, and contain 
UV blocking agents. One modern primer contains carbon 
solids and others use chemicals that work similarly to sun 
block for human skin. Typically, two to four coats of fabric 
primer are sufficient before the top coatings of the final finish 
are applied. [Figure 3-34]

The FAA-certificated mechanic must strictly adhere to all 
instructions for thinning, drying times, sanding, and cleaning. 
Small differences in the various processes exist and what 
works in one process may not be acceptable and could ruin

the finish of another process. STCs are issued on the basis 
of the holder having successfully proven the effectiveness of 
both the materials and the techniques involved. 

When the fill coats have been applied, the final appearance 
of the fabric covering job is crafted with the application 
of various topcoats. Due to the chemical nature of the fill 
coating upon which topcoats are sprayed, only specified 
materials can be used for top coating to ensure compatibility. 
Colored butyrate dope and polyurethane paint finishes are 
most common. They are sprayed on according to instructions. 

Once the topcoats are dry, the trim (N numbers, stripes, 
etc.) can be added. Strict observation of drying times and 
instructions for buffing and waxing are critical to the quality 
of the final finish. Also, note that STC instructions may 
include insight on finishing the nonfabric portions of the 
airframe to best match the fabric covering finish. 

Polyester Fabric Repairs 
Applicable Instructions
Repairs to aircraft fabric coverings are inevitable. Always 
inspect a damaged area to ensure the damage is confined 
to the fabric and does not involve the structure below. A 
technician who needs to make a fabric repair must first 
identify which approved data was used to install the covering 
that needs to be repaired. Consult the logbook where an 
entry and reference to manufacturer data, an STC, or a field 
approval possibly utilizing practices from AC 43.13-1 should 
be recorded. The source of approved data for the covering 
job is the same source of approved data used for a repair. 

This section discusses general information concerning repairs 
to polyester fabric. Thorough instructions for repairs made to 
cotton covered aircraft can be found in AC 43.13-1. It is the 
responsibility of the holder of an STC to provide maintenance 
instructions for the STC alteration in addition to materials 
specifications required to do the job. 

Repair Considerations
The type of repair performed depends on the extent of the 
damage and the process under which the fabric was installed. 
The size of the damaged area is often a reference for whether 
a patch is sufficient to do the repair or whether a new panel 
should be installed. Repair size may also dictate the amount of 
fabric-to-fabric overlap required when patching and whether 
finishing tapes are required over the patch. Many STC repair 
procedures do not require finishing tapes. Some repairs in 
AC 43.13-1 require the use of tape up to six inches wide.

While many cotton fabric repairs involve sewing, nearly 
all repairs of polyester fabric are made without sewing. It 
is possible to apply the sewing repair techniques outlined 
in AC 43.13-1 to polyester fabric, but they were developed 
primarily for cotton and linen fabrics. STC instructions for 
repairs to polyester fabric are for cemented repairs which 
most technicians prefer as they are generally considered 
easier than sewn repairs. There is no compromise to the 
strength of the fabric with either method.

Patching or replacing a section of the covering requires 
prepping the fabric area around the damage where new 
fabric is to be attached. Procedures vary widely. Dope-based 
covering systems tend toward stripping off all coatings to 
cement raw fabric to raw fabric when patching or seaming 
in a new panel. From this point, the coatings are reapplied 
and finished as in the original covering process. Some 
polyurethane-based coating processes require only a scuffing 
of the topcoat with sandpaper before adhering small patches 
that are then refinished. [Figure 3-35] Still, other processes 
may remove the topcoats and cement a patch into the sealer 
or UV blocking coating. In some repair processes, preshrunk 
fabric is used and in others, the fabric is shrunk after it is in 
place. Varying techniques and temperatures for shrinking 
and gluing the fabric into a repair also exist. 

These deviations in procedures underscore the critical nature 
of identifying and strictly adhering to the correct instructions 
from the approved data for the fabric covering in need of 
repair. A patch or panel replacement technique for one 
covering system could easily create an unairworthy repair 
if used on fabric installed with a different covering process. 


3-24

Figure 3-35. A patch over this small hole on a polyurethane top coat is repaired in accordance with the repair instructions in the STC 
under which the aircraft was re-covered. It requires only a two-inch fabric overlap and scuffing into the top coat before cementing and 
refinishing. Other STC repair instructions may not allow this repair. 

Large section panel repairs use the same proprietary adhesives 
and techniques and are only found in the instructions for 
the process used to install the fabric covering. A common 
technique for replacing any large damaged area is to replace 
all of the fabric between two adjacent structural members 
(e.g., two ribs, two longerons, between the forward and rear 
spars). Note that this is a major repair and carries with it the 
requirement to file an FAA Form 337.

Cotton-Covered Aircraft
You may encounter a cotton fabric-covered aircraft. In 
addition to other airworthiness criterion, the condition of the 
fabric under the finished surface is paramount as the cotton 
can deteriorate even while the aircraft is stored in a hangar. 
Inspection, in accordance with the manufacturer maintenance 
manual or AC 43.13-1, should be diligent. If the cotton 
covering is found to be airworthy, repairs to the fabric can 
be made under those specifications. This includes sewn-in 
and doped-in patches, as well as sewn-in and doped-in panel 
repairs. Due to the very limited number of airworthy aircraft 
that may still be covered with cotton, this handbook does 
not cover specific information on re-covering with cotton 

or cotton fabric maintenance and repair procedures. Refer to 
AC 43.13-1, Chapter 2, Fabric Covering, which thoroughly 
addresses these issues. 

Fiberglass Coverings
References to fiberglass surfaces in aircraft covering STCs, 
AC 43.13-1, and other maintenance literature address 
techniques for finishing and maintaining this kind of surface. 
However, this is typically limited to fiberglass radomes and 
fiberglass reinforced plywood surfaces and parts that are 
still in service. Use of dope-based processes on fiberglass 
is well established. Repair and apply coatings and finishes 
on fiberglass in accordance with manufacturer data, STC 
instructions, or AC 43.13-1 acceptable practices. Mildew, 
moisture, chemicals, or acids have no effect on glass fabric 
when used as a structure material. For more information on 
glass fabric, refer to AC 43.13-1(as revised).

Aircraft Metal Structural Repair
Aircraft Metal Structural Repair
The satisfactory performance of an aircraft requires continuous 
maintenance of aircraft structural integrity. It is important that 
metal structural repairs be made according to the best available 
techniques because improper repair techniques can pose an 
immediate or potential danger. The reliability of an aircraft 
depends on the quality of the design, as well as the workmanship 
used in making the repairs. The design of an aircraft metal 
structural repair is complicated by the requirement that an aircraft 
be as light as possible. If weight were not a critical factor, repairs 
could be made with a large margin of safety. In actual practice, 
repairs must be strong enough to carry all of the loads with the 
required factor of safety, but they must not have too much extra 
strength. For example, a joint that is too weak cannot be tolerated, 
but a joint that is too strong can create stress risers that may cause 
cracks in other locations. 

As discussed in Chapter 3, Aircraft Fabric Covering, sheet metal 
aircraft construction dominates modern aviation. Generally, sheet 
metal made of aluminum alloys is used in airframe sections that 
serve as both the structure and outer aircraft covering, with the 
metal parts joined with rivets or other types of fasteners. Sheet 
metal is used extensively in many types of aircraft from airliners 
to single engine airplanes, but it may also appear as part of a 
composite airplane, such as in an instrument panel. Sheet metal 
is obtained by rolling metal into flat sheets of various thicknesses 
ranging from thin (leaf) to plate (pieces thicker than 6 mm or 0.25 
inch). The thickness of sheet metal, called gauge, ranges from 8 
to 30 with the higher gauge denoting thinner metal. Sheet metal 
can be cut and bent into a variety of shapes. 


4-2

Damage to metal aircraft structures is often caused by 
corrosion, erosion, normal stress, and accidents and mishaps. 
Sometimes aircraft structure modifications require extensive 
structural rework. For example, the installation of winglets 
on aircraft not only replaces a wing tip with a winglet, but 
also requires extensive reinforcing of the wing structure to 
carry additional stresses. 

Numerous and varied methods of repairing metal structural 
portions of an aircraft exist, but no set of specific repair 
patterns applies in all cases. The problem of repairing a 
damaged section is usually solved by duplicating the original 
part in strength, kind of material, and dimensions. To make a 
structural repair, the aircraft technician needs a good working 
knowledge of sheet metal forming methods and techniques. In 
general, forming means changing the shape by bending and 
forming solid metal. In the case of aluminum, this is usually 
done at room temperature. All repair parts are shaped to fit 
in place before they are attached to the aircraft or component. 

Forming may be a very simple operation, such as making 
a single bend or a single curve, or it may be a complex 
operation, requiring a compound curvature. Before forming 
a part, the aircraft technician must give some thought to 
the complexity of the bends, the material type, the material 
thickness, the material temper, and the size of the part being 
fabricated. In most cases, these factors determine which 
forming method to use. Types of forming discussed in this 
chapter include bending, brake forming, stretch forming, roll 
forming, and spinning. The aircraft technician also needs 
a working knowledge of the proper use of the tools and 
equipment used in forming metal.

In addition to forming techniques, this chapter introduces 
the airframe technician to the tools used in sheet metal 
construction and repair, structural fasteners and their 
installation, how to inspect, classify, and assess metal 
structural damage, common repair practices, and types of 
repairs. 

The repairs discussed in this chapter are typical of those used 
in aircraft maintenance and are included to introduce some of 
the operations involved. For exact information about specific 
repairs, consult the manufacturer’s maintenance or structural 
repair manuals (SRM). General repair instructions are also 
discussed in Advisory Circular (AC) 43.13.1, Acceptable 
Methods, Techniques, and Practices—Aircraft Inspection 
and Repair.

Stresses in Structural Members
An aircraft structure must be designed so that it accepts all of 
the stresses imposed upon it by the flight and ground loads 
without any permanent deformation. Any repair made must 

accept the stresses, carry them across the repair, and then 
transfer them back into the original structure. These stresses 
are considered as flowing through the structure, so there 
must be a continuous path for them, with no abrupt changes 
in cross-sectional areas along the way. Abrupt changes in 
cross-sectional areas of aircraft structure that are subject to 
cycle loading or stresses result in a stress concentration that 
may induce fatigue cracking and eventual failure. A scratch or 
gouge in the surface of a highly stressed piece of metal causes 
a stress concentration at the point of damage and could lead 
to failure of the part. Forces acting on an aircraft, whether it 
is on the ground or in flight, introduce pulling, pushing, or 
twisting forces within the various members of the aircraft 
structure. While the aircraft is on the ground, the weight of 
the wings, fuselage, engines, and empennage causes forces 
to act downward on the wing and stabilizer tips, along the 
spars and stringers, and on the bulkheads and formers. These 
forces are passed from member to member causing bending, 
twisting, pulling, compression, and shearing forces.

As the aircraft takes off, most of the forces in the fuselage 
continue to act in the same direction; because of the motion 
of the aircraft, they increase in intensity. The forces on the 
wingtips and the wing surfaces, however, reverse direction; 
instead of being downward forces of weight, they become 
upward forces of lift. The forces of lift are exerted first 
against the skin and stringers, then are passed on to the ribs, 
and finally are transmitted through the spars to be distributed 
through the fuselage. The wings bend upward at their ends 
and may flutter slightly during flight. This wing bending 
cannot be ignored by the manufacturer in the original design 
and construction and cannot be ignored during maintenance. 
It is surprising how an aircraft structure composed of 
structural members and skin rigidly riveted or bolted together, 
such as a wing, can bend or act so much like a leaf spring.

The six types of stress in an aircraft are described as tension, 
compression, shear, bearing, bending, and torsion (or 
twisting). The first four are commonly called basic stresses; 
the last two, combination stresses. Stresses usually act in 
combinations rather than singly. [Figure 4-1]

Tension
Tension is the stress that resists a force that tends to pull apart. 
The engine pulls the aircraft forward, but air resistance tries 
to hold it back. The result is tension, which tends to stretch 
the aircraft. The tensile strength of a material is measured in 
pounds per square inch (psi) and is calculated by dividing 
the load (in pounds) required to pull the material apart by its 
cross-sectional area (in square inches).

The strength of a member in tension is determined on 
the basis of its gross area (or total area), but calculations

involving tension must take into consideration the net area of 
the member. Net area is defined as the gross area minus that 
removed by drilling holes or by making other changes in the 
section. Placing rivets or bolts in holes makes no appreciable 
difference in added strength, as the rivets or bolts will not 
transfer tensional loads across holes in which they are inserted. 

Compression
Compression, the stress that resists a crushing force, tends to 
shorten or squeeze aircraft parts. The compressive strength of 
a material is also measured in psi. Under a compressive load, 
an undrilled member is stronger than an identical member 
with holes drilled through it. However, if a plug of equivalent 
or stronger material is fitted tightly in a drilled member, it 
transfers compressive loads across the hole, and the member 
carries approximately as large a load as if the hole were not 
there. Thus, for compressive loads, the gross or total area may 
be used in determining the stress in a member if all holes are 
tightly plugged with equivalent or stronger material. 

Shear
Shear is the stress that resists the force tending to cause one 
layer of a material to slide over an adjacent layer. Two riveted
plates in tension subject the rivets to a shearing force. Usually, 
the shear strength of a material is either equal to or less than 
its tensile or compressive strength. Shear stress concerns the 
aviation technician chiefly from the standpoint of the rivet 
and bolt applications, particularly when attaching sheet metal, 
because if a rivet used in a shear application gives way, the 
riveted or bolted parts are pushed sideways. 

Bearing
Bearing stress resists the force that the rivet or bolt places 
on the hole. As a rule, the strength of the fastener should be 
such that its total shear strength is approximately equal to 
the total bearing strength of the sheet material. [Figure 4-2]

Torsion 
Torsion is the stress that produces twisting. While moving 
the aircraft forward, the engine also tends to twist it to one 
side, but other aircraft components hold it on course. Thus, 
torsion is created. The torsional strength of a material is its 
resistance to twisting or torque (twisting stress). The stresses 
arising from this action are shear stresses caused by the 
rotation of adjacent planes past each other around a common

reference axis at right angles to these planes. This action may 
be illustrated by a rod fixed solidly at one end and twisted 
by a weight placed on a lever arm at the other, producing the 
equivalent of two equal and opposite forces acting on the rod 
at some distance from each other. A shearing action is set up 
all along the rod, with the center line of the rod representing 
the neutral axis. 

Bending 
Bending (or beam stress) is a combination of compression 
and tension. The rod in Figure 4-1E has been shortened 
(compressed) on the inside of the bend and stretched on 
the outside of the bend. Note that the bending stress causes 
a tensile stress to act on the upper half of the beam and a 
compressive stress on the lower half. These stresses act in 
opposition on the two sides of the center line of the member, 
which is called the neutral axis. Since these forces acting in 
opposite directions are next to each other at the neutral axis, 
the greatest shear stress occurs along this line, and none exists 
at the extreme upper or lower surfaces of the beam.

Tools for Sheet Metal Construction and 
Repair
Without modern metalworking tools and machines, the 
job of the airframe technician would be more difficult and 
tiresome, and the time required to finish a task would be 
much greater. These specialized tools and machines help the 
airframe technician construct or repair sheet metal in a faster, 
simpler, and better manner than possible in the past. Powered 
by human muscle, electricity, or compressed air, these tools 
are used to lay out, mark, cut, sand, or drill sheet metal. 

Layout Tools
Before fitting repair parts into an aircraft structure, the new 
sections must be measured and marked, or laid out to the 
dimensions needed to make the repair part. Tools utilized 
for this process are discussed in this section. 

Scales
Scales are available in various lengths, with the 6-inch and 
12-inch scales being the most common and affordable. A 
scale with fractions on one side and decimals on the other side 
is very useful. To obtain an accurate measurement, measure 
with the scale held on edge from the 1-inch mark instead of 
the end. Use the graduation marks on the side to set a divider 
or compass. [Figure 4-3]

Combination Square
A combination square consists of a steel scale with three 
heads that can be moved to any position on the scale and 
locked in place. The three heads are a stock head that 
measures 90° and 45° angles, a protractor head that can 

measure any angle between the head and the blade, and a 
center head that uses one side of the blade as the bisector of 
a 90° angle. The center of a shaft can be found by using the 
center head. Place the end of the shaft in the V of the head 
and scribe a line along the edge of the scale. Rotate the head 
about 90° and scribe another line along the edge of the scale. 
The two lines will cross at the center of the shaft. [Figure 4-4]

Dividers
Dividers are used to transfer a measurement from a device 
to a scale to determine its value. Place the sharp points at 
the locations from which the measurement is to be taken. 
Then, place the points on a steel machinist’s scale, but put 
one of the points on the 1-inch mark and measure from there. 
[Figure 4-5]

Rivet Spacers
A rivet spacer is used to make a quick and accurate rivet 
pattern layout on a sheet. On the rivet spacer, there are 
alignment marks for 1⁄2-inch, 3⁄4-inch, 1-inch and 2-inch rivet 
spacing. [Figure 4-6]

Marking Tools
Pens
Fiber-tipped pens are the preferred method of marking 
lines and hole locations directly on aluminum, because the 
graphite in a No. 2 pencil can cause corrosion when used on

aluminum. Make the layout on the protective membrane if it 
is still on the material, or mark directly on the material with 
a fiber-tipped pen, such as a fine-point Sharpie®, or cover 
the material with masking tape and then mark on the tape.

Scribes
A scribe is a pointed instrument used to mark or score metal 
to show where it is to be cut. A scribe should only be used 
when marks will be removed by drilling or cutting because 
it makes scratches that weaken the material and could cause 
corrosion. [Figure 4-7]

Punches
Punches are usually made of carbon steel that has been 
hardened and tempered. Generally classified as solid or 
hollow, punches are designed according to their intended 
use. A solid punch is a steel rod with various shapes at the 
end for different uses. For example, it is used to drive bolts 
out of holes, loosen frozen or tight pins and keys, knock out 
rivets, pierce holes in a material, etc. The hollow punch is 
sharp edged and used most often for cutting out blanks. Solid 
punches vary in both size and point design, while hollow 
punches vary in size.

Figure 4-11. Transfer punch.

Prick Punch
A prick punch is primarily used during layout to place 
reference marks on metal because it produces a small 
indentation. [Figure 4-8] After layout is finished, the 
indentation is enlarged with a center punch to allow for 
drilling. The prick punch can also be used to transfer 
dimensions from a paper pattern directly onto the metal. 
Take the following precautions when using a prick punch: 

• Never strike a prick punch a heavy blow with a 
hammer because it could bend the punch or cause 
excessive damage to the item being worked.

• Do not use a prick punch to remove objects from holes 
because the point of the punch spreads the object and 
causes it to bind even more.

Center Punch
A center punch is used to make indentations in metal as an 
aid in drilling. [Figure 4-9] These indentations help the drill, 
which has a tendency to wander on a flat surface, stay on 
the mark as it goes through the metal. The traditional center 
punch is used with a hammer, has a heavier body than the 
prick punch, and has a point ground to an angle of about 60°. 
Take the following precautions when using a center punch:

• Never strike the center punch with enough force to 
dimple the item around the indentation or cause the 
metal to protrude through the other side of the sheet.

• Do not use a center punch to remove objects from holes 
because the point of the punch spreads the object and 
causes it to bind even more.

Automatic Center Punch
The automatic center punch performs the same function as an 
ordinary center punch, but uses a spring tension mechanism 
to create a force hard enough to make an indentation without 
the need for a hammer. The mechanism automatically strikes 
a blow of the required force when placed where needed and 
pressed. This punch has an adjustable cap for regulating 
the stroke; the point can be removed for replacement or 
sharpening. Never strike an automatic center punch with a 
hammer. [Figure 4-10]

Transfer Punch
A transfer punch uses a template or existing holes in the 
structure to mark the locations of new holes. The punch is 
centered in the old hole over the new sheet and lightly tapped 
with a mallet. The result should be a mark that serves to locate 
the hole in the new sheet. [Figure 4-11]

Drive Punch
The drive punch is made with a flat face instead of a point 
because it is used to drive out damaged rivets, pins, and 
bolts that sometimes bind in holes. The size of the punch 
is determined by the width of the face, usually 1⁄8-inch to 
1⁄4-inch. [Figure 4-12]

Pin Punch
The pin punch typically has a straight shank characterized 
by a hexagonal body. Pin punch points are sized in 1⁄32-inch 
increments of an inch and range from 1⁄16-inch to 3⁄8-inch in 
diameter. The usual method for driving out a pin or bolt is 
to start working it out with a drive punch until the shank of 
the punch is touching the sides of the hole. Then use a pin 
punch to drive the pin or bolt the rest of the way out of the 
hole. [Figure 4-13]

Chassis Punch
A chassis punch is used to make holes in sheet metal parts for 
the installation of instruments and other avionics appliance, 
as well as lightning holes in ribs and spars. Sized in 1⁄16 of 
an inch, they are available in sizes from 1⁄2 inch to 3 inches. 
[Figure 4-14]

Awl
A pointed tool for marking surfaces or for punching small 
holes, an awl is used in aircraft maintenance to place scribe 
marks on metal and plastic surfaces and to align holes, such 
as in the installation of a deicer boot. [Figure 4-15]

Procedures for one use of an awl:

1. Place the metal to be scribed on a flat surface. Place 
a ruler or straightedge on the guide marks already 
measured and placed on the metal.

2. Remove the protective cover from the awl.

3. Hold the straightedge firmly. Hold the awl, as shown 
in Figure 4-16, and scribe a line along the straightedge.

4. Replace the protective cover on the awl. 

Hole Duplicator
Available in a variety of sizes and styles, hole duplicators, 
or hole finders, utilize the old covering as a template to 
locate and match existing holes in the structure. Holes in 
a replacement sheet or in a patch must be drilled to match 
existing holes in the structure and the hole duplicator

simplifies this process. Figure 4-17 illustrates one type of 
hole duplicator. The peg on the bottom leg of the duplicator 
fits into the existing rivet hole. To make the hole in the 
replacement sheet or patch, drill through the bushing on the 
top leg. If the duplicator is properly made, holes drilled in 
this manner are in perfect alignment. A separate duplicator 
must be used for each diameter of rivet. 

Cutting Tools
Powered and nonpowered metal cutting tools available to the 
aviation technician include various types of saws, nibblers, 
shears, sanders, notchers, and grinders. 

Circular-Cutting Saws
The circular-cutting saw cuts with a toothed, steel disk that 
rotates at high speed. Handheld or table mounted and powered 
by compressed air, this power saw cuts metal or wood. To 
prevent the saw from grabbing the metal, keep a firm grip 
on the saw handle at all times. Check the blade carefully for 
cracks prior to installation because a cracked blade can fly 
apart during use, possibly causing serious injury.

Kett Saw 
The Kett saw is an electrically operated, portable circular 
cutting saw that uses blades of various diameters. [Figure 4-18] 
Since the head of this saw can be turned to any desired angle, 
it is useful for removing damaged sections on a stringer. The 
advantages of a Kett saw include:

1. Can cut metal up to 3⁄16-inch in thickness.

2. No starting hole is required.

3. A cut can be started anywhere on a sheet of metal.

4. Can cut an inside or outside radius.

Pneumatic Circular-Cutting Saw
The pneumatic circular-cutting saw, useful for cutting out 
damage, is similar to the Kett saw. [Figure 4-19]

Reciprocating Saw
The versatile reciprocating saw achieves cutting action 
through a push and pull (reciprocating) motion of the blade. 
This saw can be used right sideup or upside down, a feature 
that makes it handier than the circular saw for working in tight 
or awkward spots. A variety of blade types are available for 
reciprocating saws; blades with finer teeth are used for cutting 
through metal. The portable, air-powered reciprocating saw 
uses a standard hacksaw blade and can cut a 360° circle or 
a square or rectangular hole. Unsuited for fine precision 
work, this saw is more difficult to control than the pneumatic 
circular-cutting saw. A reciprocating saw should be used in 
such a way that at least two teeth of the saw blade are cutting 
at all times. Avoid applying too much downward pressure on 
the saw handle because the blade may break. [Figure 4-20]


4-9

Figure 4-20. Reciprocating saw.

Figure 4-21. Die grinder and cut-off wheel.

Figure 4-22. Nibbler.

Figure 4-23. Power squaring shear.

Cut-off Wheel
A cut-off wheel is a thin abrasive disc driven by a high-speed 
pneumatic die-grinder and used to cut out damage on aircraft 
skin and stringers. The wheels come in different thicknesses 
and sizes. [Figure 4-21]

Nibblers
Usually powered by compressed air, the nibbler is another 
tool for cutting sheet metal. Portable nibblers utilize a high 
speed blanking action (the lower die moves up and down and 
meets the upper stationary die) to cut the metal. [Figure 4-22] 
The shape of the lower die cuts out small pieces of metal 
approximately 1⁄16 inch wide.

The cutting speed of the nibbler is controlled by the thickness 
of the metal being cut. Nibblers satisfactorily cut through 
sheets of metal with a maximum thickness of 1⁄16 inch. Too 
much force applied to the metal during the cutting operation 
clogs the dies (shaped metal), causing them to fail or the motor 
to overheat. Both electric and hand nibblers are available.

Shop Tools
Due to size, weight, and/or power source, shop tools are 
usually in a fixed location, and the airframe part to be 
constructed or repaired is brought to the tool.

Squaring Shear
The squaring shear provides the airframe technician with 
a convenient means of cutting and squaring sheet metal. 
Available as a manual, hydraulic, or pneumatic model, 
this shear consists of a stationary lower blade attached to 
a bed and a movable upper blade attached to a crosshead. 
[Figure 4-23]

Two squaring fences, consisting of thick strips of metal used 
for squaring metal sheets, are placed on the bed. One squaring 
fence is placed on the right side and one on the left to form a 
90° angle with the blades. A scale graduated in fractions of 
an inch is scribed on the bed for ease in placement.

To make a cut with a foot shear, move the upper blade down 
by placing the foot on the treadle and pushing downward. 
Once the metal is cut and foot pressure removed, a spring 
raises the blade and treadle. Hydraulic or pneumatic models 
utilize remote foot pedals to ensure operator safety. 


4-10

Figure 4-24. Foot-operated squaring shear. 

Figure 4-25. Throatless shears.

Figure 4-26. Scroll shears. 

The squaring shear performs three distinctly different 
operations:

1. Cutting to a line

2. Squaring

3. Multiple cutting to a specific size

When cutting to a line, place the sheet on the bed of the shears 
in front of the cutting blade with the cutting line even with 
the cutting edge of the bed. To cut the sheet with a foot shear, 
step on the treadle while holding the sheet securely in place. 

Squaring requires several steps. First, one end of the sheet 
is squared with an edge (the squaring fence is usually used 
on the edge). Then, the remaining edges are squared by 
holding one squared end of the sheet against the squaring 
fence and making the cut, one edge at a time, until all edges 
have been squared.

When several pieces must be cut to the same dimensions, use 
the backstop, located on the back of the cutting edge on most 
squaring shears. The supporting rods are graduated in fractions 
of an inch and the gauge bar may be set at any point on the rods. 
Set the gauge bar the desired distance from the cutting blade 
of the shears and push each piece to be cut against the gauge 
bar. All the pieces can then be cut to the same dimensions 
without measuring and marking each one separately.

Foot-operated shears have a maximum metal cutting capacity 
of 0.063 inch of aluminum alloy. Use powered squaring 
shears for cutting thicker metals. [Figure 4-24]

Throatless Shear 
Airframe technicians use the throatless shear to cut aluminum 
sheets up to 0.063 inches. This shear takes its name from the 
fact that metal can be freely moved around the cutting blade 
during cutting because the shear lacks a “throat” down which 

metal must be fed. [Figure 4-25] This feature allows great 
flexibility in what shapes can be cut because the metal can 
be turned to any angle for straight, curved, and irregular cuts. 
Also, a sheet of any length can be cut. 

A hand lever operates the cutting blade which is the top blade. 
Throatless shears made by the Beverly Shear Manufacturing 
Corporation, called BeverlyTM shears, are often used.

Scroll Shears
Scroll shears are used for cutting irregular lines on the 
inside of a sheet without cutting through to the edge. 
[Figure 4-26] The upper cutting blade is stationary while 
the lower blade is movable. A handle connected to the lower 
blade operates the machine.

Figure 4-27. Rotary punch press.

Figure 4-28. Band saw.

Figure 4-29. Combination disk and belt sander.

Rotary Punch Press
Used in the airframe repair shop to punch holes in metal 
parts, the rotary punch can cut radii in corners, make washers, 
and perform many other jobs where holes are required. 
[Figure 4-27] The machine is composed of two cylindrical 
turrets, one mounted over the other and supported by the 
frame, with both turrets synchronized to rotate together. 
Index pins, which ensure correct alignment at all times, may 
be released from their locking position by rotating a lever 
on the right side of the machine. This action withdraws the 
index pins from the tapered holes and allows an operator to 
turn the turrets to any size punch desired.

When rotating the turret to change punches, release the 
index lever when the desired die is within 1 inch of the ram, 
and continue to rotate the turret slowly until the top of the 
punch holder slides into the grooved end of the ram. The 
tapered index locking pins will then seat themselves in the 
holes provided and, at the same time, release the mechanical 
locking device, which prevents punching until the turrets are 
aligned.To operate the machine, place the metal to be worked 
between the die and punch. Pull the lever on the top of the 
machine toward the operator, actuating the pinion shaft, gear 
segment, toggle link, and the ram, forcing the punch through 
the metal. When the lever is returned to its original position, 
the metal is removed from the punch.

The diameter of the punch is stamped on the front of each 
die holder. Each punch has a point in its center that is 
placed in the center punch mark to punch the hole in the  
correct location. 

Band Saw
A band saw consists of a toothed metal band coupled to, 
and continuously driven around, the circumferences of two 
wheels. It is used to cut aluminum, steel, and composite parts. 

[Figure 4-28] The speed of the band saw and the type and 
style of the blade depends on the material to be cut. Band 
saws are often designated to cut one type of material, and 
if a different material is to be cut, the blade is changed. The 
speed is controllable and the cutting platform can be tilted 
to cut angled pieces.

Disk Sander
Disk sanders have a powered abrasive-covered disk or belt 
and are used for smoothing or polishing surfaces. The sander 
unit uses abrasive paper of different grits to trim metal parts. 
It is much quicker to use a disk sander than to file a part to 
the correct dimension. The combination disk and belt sander 
has a vertical belt sander coupled with a disk sander and is 
often used in a metal shop. [Figure 4-29]


4-12

Tool rest

Figure 4-30. Belt sander.

Figure 4-31. Notcher.

Figure 4-32. Power notcher. 

Figure 4-33. Grinder.

Belt Sander
The belt sander uses an endless abrasive belt driven by an 
electric motor to sand down metal parts much like the disk 
sander unit. The abrasive paper used on the belt comes in 
different degrees of grit or coarseness. The belt sander is 
available as a vertical or horizontal unit. The tension and 
tracking of the abrasive belt can be adjusted so the belt runs 
in the middle. [Figure 4-30]

Notcher
The notcher is used to cut out metal parts, with some 
machines capable of shearing, squaring, and trimming 
metal. [Figure 4-31] The notcher consists of a top and 
bottom die and most often cuts at a 90° angle, although some 
machines can cut metal into angles up to 180°. Notchers 
are available in manual and pneumatic models able to cut 
various thicknesses of mild steel and aluminum. This is an 

excellent tool for quickly removing corners from sheet metal 
parts. [Figure 4-32]

Wet or Dry Grinder
Grinding machines come in a variety of types and sizes, 
depending upon the class of work for which they are to be 
used. Dry and/or wet grinders are found in airframe repair 
shops. Grinders can be bench or pedestal mounted. A dry 
grinder usually has a grinding wheel on each end of a shaft 
that runs through an electric motor or a pulley operated by a 
belt. The wet grinder has a pump to supply a flow of water 
on a single grinding wheel. The water acts as a lubricant for 
faster grinding while it continuously cools the edge of the 
metal, reducing the heat produced by material being ground 
against the wheel. It also washes away any bits of metal or 
abrasive removed during the grinding operation. The water 
returns to a tank and can be re-used.

Grinders are used to sharpen knives, tools, and blades as 
well as grinding steel, metal objects, drill bits, and tools. 
Figure 4-33 illustrates a common type bench grinder 
found in most airframe repair shops. It can be used to 


4-13

Figure 4-34. Straight snips.

Figure 4-35. Aviation snips.

dress mushroomed heads on chisels and points on chisels, 
screwdrivers, and drills, as well as for removing excess metal 
from work and smoothing metal surfaces.

The bench grinder is generally equipped with one medium-
grit and one fine-grit abrasive wheel. The medium-grit wheel 
is usually used for rough grinding where a considerable 
quantity of material is to be removed or where a smooth finish 
is unimportant. The fine-grit wheel is used for sharpening 
tools and grinding to close limits. It removes metal more 
slowly, gives the work a smooth finish, and does not generate 
enough heat to anneal the edges of cutting tools.

Before using any type of grinder, ensure that the abrasive 
wheels are firmly held on the spindles by the flange nuts. 
An abrasive wheel that comes off or becomes loose could 
seriously injure the operator in addition to ruining the grinder. 
A loose tool rest could cause the tool or piece of work to be 
“grabbed” by the abrasive wheel and cause the operator’s 
hand to come in contact with the wheel, possibly resulting 
in severe wounds. 

Always wear goggles when using a grinder, even if eyeshields 
are attached to the grinder. Goggles should fit firmly against 
the face and nose. This is the only way to protect the eyes 
from the fine pieces of steel. Goggles that do not fit properly 
should be exchanged for ones that do fit. Be sure to check 
the abrasive wheel for cracks before using the grinder. A 
cracked abrasive wheel is likely to fly apart when turning at 
high speeds. Never use a grinder unless it is equipped with 
wheel guards that are firmly in place.

Grinding Wheels
A grinding wheel is made of a bonded abrasive and provides 
an efficient way to cut, shape, and finish metals. Available in 
a wide variety of sizes and numerous shapes, grinding wheels 
are also used to sharpen knives, drill bits, and many other 
tools, or to clean and prepare surfaces for painting or plating.

Grinding wheels are removable and a polishing or buffing 
wheel can be substituted for the abrasive wheel. Silicon 
carbide and aluminum oxide are the kinds of abrasives used 
in most grinding wheels. Silicon carbide is the cutting agent 
for grinding hard, brittle material, such as cast iron. It is 
also used in grinding aluminum, brass, bronze, and copper. 
Aluminum oxide is the cutting agent for grinding steel and 
other metals of high tensile strength.

Hand Cutting Tools
Many types of hand cutting tools are available to cut light 
gauge sheet metal. Four cutting tools commonly found in the 
air frame repair shop are straight hand snips, aviation snips, 
files, and burring tools.

Straight Snips
Straight snips, or sheet metal shears, have straight 
blades with cutting edges sharpened to an 85° angle. 
[Figure 4-34] Available in sizes ranging from 6 to 14 inches, 
they cut aluminum up to 1⁄16 of an inch. Straight snips can be 
used for straight cutting and large curves, but aviation snips 
are better for cutting circles or arcs.

Aviation Snips
Aviation snips are used to cut holes, curved parts, round 
patches, and doublers (a piece of metal placed under a part 
to make it stiffer) in sheet metal. Aviation snips have colored 
handles to identify the direction of the cuts: yellow aviation 
snips cut straight, green aviation snips curve right, and red 
aviation snips curve left. [Figure 4-35]

Files
The file is an important but often overlooked tool used to 
shape metal by cutting and abrasion. Files have five distinct 
properties: length, contour, the form in cross section, the 
kind of teeth, and the fineness of the teeth. Many different 
types of files are available and the sizes range from 3 to 18 
inches. [Figure 4-36]


4-14

Figure 4-36. Files. Figure 4-37. Die grinder.

Figure 4-38. Burring tools.

The portion of the file on which the teeth are cut is called the 
face. The tapered end that fits into the handle is called the 
tang. The part of the file where the tang begins is the heel. 
The length of a file is the distance from the point or tip to the 
heel and does not include the tang. The teeth of the file do 
the cutting. These teeth are set at an angle across the face of 
the file. A file with a single row of parallel teeth is called a 
single-cut file. The teeth are cut at an angle of 65°–85° to the 
centerline, depending on the intended use of the file. Files 
that have one row of teeth crossing another row in a crisscross 
pattern are called double-cut files. The angle of the first set 
usually is 40°–50° and that of the crossing teeth 70°–80°. 
Crisscrossing produces a surface that has a very large number 
of little teeth that slant toward the tip of the file. Each little 
tooth looks like an end of a diamond point cold chisel.

Files are graded according to the tooth spacing; a coarse file 
has a small number of large teeth, and a smooth file has a large 
number of fine teeth. The coarser the teeth, the more metal is 
removed on each stroke of the file. The terms used to indicate 
the coarseness or fineness of a file are rough, coarse, bastard, 
second cut, smooth, and dead smooth, and the file may be 
either single cut or double cut. Files are further classified 
according to their shape. Some of the more common types 
are: flat, triangle, square, half round, and round.

There are several filing techniques. The most common is to 
remove rough edges and slivers from the finished part before 
it is installed. Crossfiling is a method used for filing the 
edges of metal parts that must fit tightly together. Crossfiling 
involves clamping the metal between two strips of wood 
and filing the edge of the metal down to a preset line. Draw 
filing is used when larger surfaces need to be smoothed and 
squared. It is done by drawing the file over the entire surface 
of the work.

To protect the teeth of a file, files should be stored separately 
in a plastic wrap or hung by their handles. Files kept in a 
toolbox should be wrapped in waxed paper to prevent rust 

from forming on the teeth. File teeth can be cleaned with a 
file card. 

Die Grinder
A die grinder is a handheld tool that turns a mounted 
cutoff wheel, rotary file, or sanding disk at high speed. 
[Figure 4-37] Usually powered by compressed air, electric 
die grinders are also used. Pneumatic die grinders run at 
12,000 to 20,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) with the 
rotational speed controlled by the operator who uses a hand- 
or foot-operated throttle to vary the volume of compressed 
air. Available in straight, 45°, and 90° models, the die 
grinder is excellent for weld breaking, smoothing sharp 
edges, deburring, porting, and general high-speed polishing, 
grinding, and cutting. 

Burring Tool
This type of tool is used to remove a burr from an edge of a 
sheet or to deburr a hole. [Figure 4-38]

Hole Drilling
Drilling holes is a common operation in the airframe repair 
shop. Once the fundamentals of drills and their uses are 
learned, drilling holes for rivets and bolts on light metal is 


4-15

Figure 4-39. Drill motors.

Figure 4-40. Angle drill motors.

Figure 4-41. Nutplate drill.

not difficult. While a small portable power drill is usually 
the most practical tool for this common operation in airframe 
metalwork, sometimes a drill press may prove to be the better 
piece of equipment for the job.

Portable Power Drills
Portable power drills operate by electricity or compressed air. 
Pneumatic drill motors are recommended for use on repairs 
around flammable materials where potential sparks from an 
electric drill motor might become a fire hazard.

When using the portable power drill, hold it firmly with both 
hands. Before drilling, be sure to place a backup block of 
wood under the hole to be drilled to add support to the metal 
structure. The drill bit should be inserted in the chuck and 
tested for trueness or vibration. This may be visibly checked 
by running the motor freely. A drill bit that wobbles or is 
slightly bent should not be used since such a condition causes 
enlarged holes. The drill should always be held at right angles 
to the work regardless of the position or curvatures. Tilting 
the drill at any time when drilling into or withdrawing from 
the material may cause elongation (egg shape) of the hole. 
When drilling through sheet metal, small burrs are formed 
around the edge of the hole. Burrs must be removed to allow 
rivets or bolts to fit snugly and to prevent scratching. Burrs 
may be removed with a bearing scraper, a countersink, or 
a drill bit larger than the hole. If a drill bit or countersink 
is used, it should be rotated by hand. Always wear safety 
goggles while drilling.

Pneumatic Drill Motors
Pneumatic drill motors are the most common type of drill 
motor for aircraft repair work. [Figure 4-39] They are 
lightweight and have sufficient power and good speed 
control. Drill motors are available in many different sizes 
and models. Most drill motors used for aircraft sheet metal 
work are rated at 3,000 rpm, but if drilling deep holes or 
drilling in hard materials, such as corrosion resistant steel 

or titanium, a drill motor with more torque and lower rpm 
should be selected to prevent damage to tools and materials.

Right Angle and 45° Drill Motors
Right angle and 45° drill motors are used for positions that are 
not accessible with a pistol grip drill motor. Most right angle 
drill motors use threaded drill bits that are available in several 
lengths. Heavy-duty right angle drills are equipped with a 
chuck similar to the pistol grip drill motor. [Figure 4-40]

Two Hole 
Special drill motors that drill two holes at the same time are 
used for the installation of nutplates. By drilling two holes 
at the same time, the distance between the holes is fixed and 
the holes line up perfectly with the holes in the nutplate. 
[Figure 4-41]

Drill Press
The drill press is a precision machine used for drilling holes 
that require a high degree of accuracy. It serves as an accurate 
means of locating and maintaining the direction of a hole that 
is to be drilled and provides the operator with a feed lever 
that makes the task of feeding the drill into the work easier. 


4-16

Figure 4-42. Drill press. 

The upright drill press is the most common of the variety of 
drill presses available. [Figure 4-42]

When using a drill press, the height of the drill press table is 
adjusted to accommodate the height of the part to be drilled. 
When the height of the part is greater than the distance 
between the drill and the table, the table is lowered. When 
the height of the part is less than the distance between the 
drill and the table, the table is raised.

After the table is properly adjusted, the part is placed on the 
table and the drill is brought down to aid in positioning the 
metal so that the hole to be drilled is directly beneath the point 
of the drill. The part is then clamped to the drill press table to 
prevent it from slipping during the drilling operation. Parts 
not properly clamped may bind on the drill and start spinning, 
causing serious cuts on the operator’s arms or body, or loss 
of fingers or hands. Always make sure the part to be drilled 
is properly clamped to the drill press table before starting 
the drilling operation.

The degree of accuracy that it is possible to attain when using 
the drill press depends to a certain extent on the condition of 
the spindle hole, sleeves, and drill shank. Therefore, special 
care must be exercised to keep these parts clean and free from 
nicks, dents, and warpage. Always be sure that the sleeve is 
securely pressed into the spindle hole. Never insert a broken 
drill in a sleeve or spindle hole. Be careful never to use the 
sleeve-clamping vise to remove a drill since this may cause 
the sleeve to warp.

The drill speed on a drill press is adjustable. Always select the 
optimum drill speed for the material to be drilled. Technically, 
the speed of a drill bit means its speed at the circumference, 
in surface feet per minute (sfm). The recommended speed for 
drilling aluminum alloy is from 200 to 300 sfm, and for mild 
steel is 30 to 50 sfm. In practice, this must be converted into 
rpm for each size drill. Machinist and mechanic handbooks 

include drill rpm charts or drill rpm may be computed by 
use of the formula:

CS × 4 = rpm
                                         D    

CS = The recommended cutting speed in sfm

D = The diameter of the drill bit in inches

Example: At what rpm should a 1⁄8-inch drill turn to drill 
aluminum at 300 sfm?

Drill Extensions and Adapters 
When access to a place where drilling is difficult or 
impossible with a straight drill motor, various types of drill 
extensions and adapters are used. 

Extension Drill Bits
Extension drill bits are widely used for drilling holes in 
locations that require reaching through small openings or 
past projections. These drill bits, which come in 6- to 12-
inch lengths, are high speed with spring-tempered shanks. 
Extension drill bits are ground to a special notched point, 
which reduces end thrust to a minimum. When using 
extension drill bits always:

1. Select the shortest drill bit that will do the job. It is 
easier to control.

2. Check the drill bit for straightness. A bent drill bit 
makes an oversized hole and may whip, making it 
difficult to control.

3. Keep the drill bit under control. Extension drills 
smaller than 1⁄4-inch must be supported by a drill 
guard made from a piece of tubing or spring to prevent 
whipping.

Straight Extension
A straight extension for a drill can be made from an ordinary 
piece of drill rod. The drill bit is attached to the drill rod by 
shrink fitting, brazing, or silver soldering. 

Angle Adapters 
Angle adapters can be attached to an electric or pneumatic 
drill when the location of the hole is inaccessible to a straight 
drill. Angle adapters have an extended shank fastened to 
the chuck of the drill. The drill is held in one hand and the 
adapter in the other to prevent the adapter from spinning 
around the drill chuck.

Snake Attachment
The snake attachment is a flexible extension used for drilling 
in places inaccessible to ordinary drills. Available for electric

Types of Drill Bits 
A wide variety of drill bits including specialty bits for specific 
jobs are available. Figure 4-44 illustrates the parts of the 
drill bit and Figure 4-45 shows some commonly used drill 
bits. High speed steel (HSS) drill bits come in short shank or 
standard length, sometimes called jobbers length. HSS drill 
bits can withstand temperatures nearing the critical range of 
1,400 °F (dark cherry red) without losing their hardness. The 
industry standard for drilling metal (aluminum, steel, etc.), 
these drill bits stay sharper longer. 

Step Drill Bits
Typically, the procedure for drilling holes larger than 3⁄16 
inch in sheet metal is to drill a pilot hole with a No. 40 or 
No. 30 drill bit and then to oversize with a larger drill bit to 
the correct size. The step drill combines these two functions 
into one step. The step drill bit consists of a smaller pilot 
drill point that drills the initial small hole. When the drill bit 
is advanced further into the material, the second step of the 
drill bit enlarges the hole to the desired size.

Step drill bits are designed to drill round holes in most metals, 
plastic, and wood. Commonly used in general construction 
and plumbing, they work best on softer materials, such as 
plywood, but can be used on very thin sheet metal. Step drill 
bits can also be used to deburr holes left by other bits.

Cobalt Alloy Drill Bits
Cobalt alloy drill bits are designed for hard, tough metals like 
corrosion-resistant steel and titanium. It is important for the 
aircraft technician to note the difference between HSS and 
cobalt, because HSS drill bits wear out quickly when drilling 
titanium or stainless. Cobalt drill bits are excellent for drilling 
titanium or stainless steel, but do not produce a quality hole 
in aluminum alloys. Cobalt drill bits can be recognized by 
thicker webs and a taper at the end of the drill shank. 

Twist Drill Bits
Easily the most popular drill bit type, the twist drill bit has 
spiral grooves or flutes running along its working length. 
[Figure 4-46] This drill bit comes in a single-fluted, two-
fluted, three-fluted, and four-fluted styles. Single-fluted and 
two-fluted drill bits (most commonly available) are used for 
originating holes. Three-fluted and four-fluted drill bits are 
used interchangeably to enlarge existing holes. Twist drill

bits are available in a wide choice of tooling materials and 
lengths with the variations targeting specific projects.

The standard twist drill bits used for drilling aluminum are 
made from HSS and have a 135° split point. Drill bits for 
titanium are made from cobalt vanadium for increased wear 
resistance. 

Drill Bit Sizes
Drill diameters are grouped by three size standards: number, 
letter, and fractional. The decimal equivalents of standard 
drill are shown in Figure 4-47.

Drill Lubrication
Normal drilling of sheet material does not require lubrication, 
but lubrication should be provided for all deeper drilling 
Lubricants serve to assist in chip removal, which prolongs drill 
life and ensures a good finish and dimensional accuracy of the 
hole. It does not prevent overheating. The use of a lubricant 
is always a good practice when drilling castings, forgings, or 
heavy gauge stock. A good lubricant should be thin enough 
to help in chip removal but thick enough to stick to the drill. 
For aluminum, titanium, and corrosion-resistant steel, a cetyl 
alcohol based lubricant is the most satisfactory. Cetyl alcohol is 
a nontoxic fatty alcohol chemical produced in liquid, paste, and 
solid forms. The solid stick and block forms quickly liquefy at

drilling temperatures. For steel, sulfurized mineral cutting oil is 
superior. Sulfur has an affinity for steel, which aids in holding 
the cutting oil in place. In the case of deep drilling, the drill 
should be withdrawn at intervals to relieve chip packing and 
to ensure the lubricant reaches the point. As a general rule, if 
the drill is large or the material hard, use a lubricant.

Reamers
Reamers, used for enlarging holes and finishing them 
smooth to a required size, are made in many styles. They 
can be straight or tapered, solid or expansive, and come 
with straight or helical flutes. Figure 4-48 illustrates three 
types of reamers:

1. Three or four fluted production bullet reamers are 
customarily used where a finer finish and/or size is 
needed than can be achieved with a standard drill bit.

2. Standard or straight reamer.

3. Piloted reamer, with the end reduced to provide 
accurate alignment.

The cylindrical parts of most straight reamers are not cutting 
edges, but merely grooves cut for the full length of the reamer 
body. These grooves provide a way for chips to escape and 
a channel for lubricant to reach the cutting edge. Actual 
cutting is done on the end of the reamer. The cutting edges 
are normally ground to a bevel of 45° ± 5°.

Reamer flutes are not designed to remove chips like a drill. 
Do not attempt to withdraw a reamer by turning it in the 
reverse direction because chips can be forced into the surface, 
scarring the hole.

Drill Stops
A spring drill stop is a wise investment. [Figure 4-49] 
Properly adjusted, it can prevent excessive drill penetration 
that might damage underlying structure or injure personnel 
and prevent the drill chuck from marring the surface. Drill 
stops can be made from tubing, fiber rod, or hard rubber.

Drill Bushings and Guides
There are several types of tools available that aid in holding 
the drill perpendicular to the part. They consist of a hardened 
bushing anchored in a holder. [Figure 4-50]

Drill bushing types:

1. Tube—hand-held in an existing hole

2. Commercial—twist lock

3. Commercial—threaded 

Drill Bushing Holder Types
There are four types of drill bushing holder:

1. Standard—fine for drilling flat stock or tubing/rod; 
uses insert-type bushings.

2. Egg cup—improvement on standard tripod base; 
allows drilling on both flat and curved material; 
interchangeable bushings allows flexibility. 
[Figure 4-51]

3. Plate—used primarily for interchangeable production 
components; uses commercial bushings and self-
feeding drills.

4. Arm—used when drilling critical structure; 
can be locked in position; uses interchangeable  
commercial bushings.

Hole Drilling Techniques
Precise location of drilled holes is sometimes required. 
When locating holes to close tolerances, accurately located 
punch marks need to be made. If a punch mark is too small, 
the chisel edge of the drill bit may bridge it and “walk off” 
the exact location before starting. If the punch mark is too 
heavy, it may deform the metal and/or result in a local strain 
hardening where the drill bit is to start cutting. The best size 
for a punch mark is about the width of the chisel edge of the 
drill bit to be used. This holds the drill point in place while 
starting. The procedure that ensures accurate holes follows: 
[Figure 4-52]

1. Measure and lay out the drill locations carefully and 
mark with crossed lines.

 NOTE: The chisel edge is the least efficient operating 
surface element of the twist drill bit because it does 
not cut, but actually squeezes or extrudes the work 
material. 

2. Use a sharp prick punch or spring-loaded center punch 
and magnifying glass to further mark the holes.

3. Seat a properly ground center punch (120°–135°) in 
the prick punch mark and, holding the center punch 
perpendicular to the surface, strike a firm square blow 
with a hammer.

4. Mark each hole with a small drill bit (1⁄16-inch 
recommended) to check and adjust the location prior 
to pilot drilling.

5. For holes 3⁄16-inch and larger, pilot drilling is 
recommended. Select a drill bit equal to the width 
of the chisel edge of the final drill bit size. Avoid 
using a pilot drill bit that is too large because it would 
cause the corners and cutting lips of the final drill bit 
to be dulled, burned, or chipped. It also contributes 
to chattering and drill motor stalling. Pilot drill at  
each mark.

6. Place the drill point at the center of the crossed lines, 
perpendicular to the surface, and, with light pressure, 
start drilling slowly. Stop drilling after a few turns and 
check to see if the drill bit is starting on the mark. It 
should be; if not, it is necessary to walk the hole a little 
by pointing the drill in the direction it should go, and 
rotating it carefully and intermittently until properly 
lined up.

7. Enlarge each pilot drilled hole to final size.

Drilling Large Holes
The following technique can be used to drill larger holes. 
Special tooling has been developed to drill large holes to 
precise tolerances. [Figure 4-53]

1. Pilot drill using a drill bushing. Bushings are sized for 
1⁄8, 3⁄16, or 1⁄4 drill bits.

2. Step drill bits are used to step the hole to approximately 
1⁄64-inch smaller than the final hole size. The aligning 
step diameter matches the pilot drill bit size.

3. Finish ream to size using a step reamer. The aligning 
step diameter matches the core drill bit size. Reamers 
should be available for both clearance and interference 
fit hole sizes.

 NOTE: Holes can also be enlarged by using a series 
of step reamers.

Chip Chasers
The chip chaser is designed to remove chips and burrs lodged 
between sheets of metal after drilling holes for riveting. 
[Figure 4-54] Chip chasers have a plastic molded handle 
and a flexible steel blade with a hook in the end.

Forming Tools
Sheet metal forming dates back to the days of the blacksmith 
who used a hammer and hot oven to mold metal into the 
desired form. Today’s aircraft technician relies on a wide 
variety of powered and hand-operated tools to precisely bend 
and fold sheet metal to achieve the perfect shape. Forming 
tools include straight line machines, such as the bar folder and 
press brake, as well as rotary machines, such as the slip roll 
former. Forming sheet metal requires a variety of tools and 
equipment (both powered and manual), such as the piccolo 
former, shrinking and stretching tools, form blocks, and 
specialized hammers and mallets. [Figure 4-55]

Tempered sheet stock is used in forming operations whenever 
possible in typical repairs. Forming that is performed in the 
tempered condition, usually at room temperature, is known 
as cold-forming. Cold forming eliminates heat treatment and 
the straightening and checking operations required to remove 
the warp and twist caused by the heat treating process. Cold-
formed sheet metal experiences a phenomenon known as 
spring-back, which causes the worked piece to spring back 
slightly when the deforming force is removed. If the material 
shows signs of cracking during cold forming over small radii, 
the material should be formed in the annealed condition. 

Annealing, the process of toughening steel by gradually 
heating and cooling it, removes the temper from metal, 
making it softer and easier to form. Parts containing small 
radii or compound curvatures must be formed in the annealed 
condition. After forming, the part is heat treated to a tempered 
condition before use on the aircraft.

Construction of interchangeable structural and nonstructural 
parts is achieved by forming flat sheet stock to make channel, 
angle, zee, and hat section members. Before a sheet metal part 
is formed, a flat pattern is made to show how much material 
is required in the bend areas, at what point the sheet must be 
inserted into the forming tool, or where bend lines are located. 
Determination of bend lines and bend allowances is discussed 
in greater detail in the section on layout and forming.

Bar Folding Machine
The bar folder is designed for use in making bends or folds 
along edges of sheets. [Figure 4-56] This machine is best 
suited for folding small hems, flanges, seams, and edges to 
be wired. Most bar folders have a capacity for metal up to 22 
gauge in thickness and 42 inches in length. Before using the 
bar folder, several adjustments must be made for thickness of 
material, width of fold, sharpness of fold, and angle of fold. 
The adjustment for thickness of material is made by adjusting 
the screws at each end of the folder. As this adjustment is

Clamping fingers

made, place a piece of metal of the desired thickness in the 
folder and raise the operating handle until the small roller 
rests on the cam. Hold the folding blade in this position and 
adjust the setscrews until the metal is clamped securely and 
evenly the full length of the folding blade. After the folder 
has been adjusted, test each end of the machine separately 
with a small piece of metal by actually folding it.

There are two positive stops on the folder, one for 45° folds 
or bends and the other for 90° folds or bends. A collar is 
provided that can be adjusted to any degree of bend within 
the capacity of the machine.

For forming angles of 45° or 90°, the appropriate stop is 
moved into place. This allows the handle to be moved 
forward to the correct angle. For forming other angles, the 
adjustable collar is used. This is accomplished by loosening 
the setscrew and setting the stop at the desired angle. After 
setting the stop, tighten the setscrew and complete the bend. 
To make the fold, adjust the machine correctly and then 
insert the metal. The metal goes between the folding blade 
and the jaw. Hold the metal firmly against the gauge and 
pull the operating handle toward the body. As the handle 
is brought forward, the jaw automatically raises and holds 
the metal until the desired fold is made. When the handle is 
returned to its original position, the jaw and blade return to 
their original positions and release the metal.

Cornice Brake
A brake is similar to a bar folder because it is also used for 
turning or bending the edges of sheet metal. The cornice brake 
is more useful than the bar folder because its design allows 
the sheet metal to be folded or formed to pass through the 
jaws from front to rear without obstruction. [Figure 4-57] In 
contrast, the bar folder can form a bend or edge only as wide 
as the depth of its jaws. Thus, any bend formed on a bar folder 
can also be made on the cornice brake.

In making ordinary bends with the cornice brake, the sheet 
is placed on the bed with the sight line (mark indicating line 
of bend) directly under the edge of the clamping bar. The 
clamping bar is then brought down to hold the sheet firmly 
in place. The stop at the right side of the brake is set for the 
proper angle or amount of bend and the bending leaf is raised 
until it strikes the stop. If other bends are to be made, the 
clamping bar is lifted and the sheet is moved to the correct 
position for bending.

The bending capacity of a cornice brake is determined by the 
manufacturer. Standard capacities of this machine are from 
12- to 22-gauge sheet metal, and bending lengths are from 3 
to 12 feet. The bending capacity of the brake is determined by 
the bending edge thickness of the various bending leaf bars.

Most metals have a tendency to return to their normal 
shape—a characteristic known as spring-back. If the cornice 
brake is set for a 90° bend, the metal bent probably forms 
an angle of about 87° to 88°. Therefore, if a bend of 90° is 
desired, set the cornice brake to bend an angle of about 93° 
to allow for spring-back.

Box and Pan Brake (Finger Brake)
The box and pan brake, often called the finger brake because 
it is equipped with a series of steel fingers of varying widths, 
lacks the solid upper jaw of the cornice brake. [Figure 4-58] 
The box and pan brake can be used to do everything that the 
cornice brake can do, as well as several things the cornice 
brake cannot do.

The box and pan brake is used to form boxes, pans, and 
other similar shaped objects. If these shapes were formed 
on a cornice brake, part of the bend on one side of the box 
would have to be straightened in order to make the last bend. 
With a finger brake, simply remove the fingers that are in the 
way and use only the fingers required to make the bend. The 
fingers are secured to the upper leaf by thumbscrews. All the

fingers not removed for an operation must be securely seated 
and firmly tightened before the brake is used. The radius of 
the nose on the clamping fingers is usually rather small and 
frequently requires nose radius shims to be custom made for 
the total length of the bend. 

Press Brake
Since most cornice brakes and box and pan brakes are limited 
to a maximum forming capacity of approximately 0.090-
inch annealed aluminum, 0.063-inch 7075T6, or 0.063-inch 
stainless steel, operations that require the forming of thicker 
and more complex parts use a press brake. [Figure 4-59] 
The press brake is the most common machine tool used to 
bend sheet metal and applies force via mechanical and/or 
hydraulic components to shape the sheet metal between the 
punch and die. Narrow U-channels (especially with long legs) 
and hat channel stringers can be formed on the press brake 
by using special gooseneck or offset dies. Special urethane 
lower dies are useful for forming channels and stringers. 
Power press brakes can be set up with back stops (some are 
computer controlled) for high volume production. Press brake 
operations are usually done manually and require skill and 
knowledge of safe use.

Slip Roll Former
With the exception of the brake, the slip roll is probably 
used more than any other machine in the shop. [Figure 4-60] 
This machine is used to form sheets into cylinders or other 
straight curved surfaces. It consists of right and left end 
frames with three solid rolls mounted in between. Gears, 
which are operated by either a hand crank or a power drive, 
connect the two gripping rolls. These rolls can be adjusted to 


4-24

the thickness of the metal by using the two adjusting screws 
located on the bottom of each frame. The two most common 
of these forming machines are the slip roll former and the 
rotary former. Available in various sizes and capabilities, 
these machines come in manual or powered versions. 

The slip roll former in Figure 4-60 is manually operated and 
consists of three rolls, two housings, a base, and a handle. 
The handle turns the two front rolls through a system of gears 
enclosed in the housing. The front rolls serve as feeding, or 
gripping, rolls. The rear roll gives the proper curvature to 
the work. When the metal is started into the machine, the 
rolls grip the metal and carry it to the rear roll, which curves 
it. The desired radius of a bend is obtained by the rear roll. 
The bend radius of the part can be checked as the forming 
operation progresses by using a circle board or radius gauge. 
The gauges can be made by cutting a piece of material to 
the required finished radius and comparing it to the radius 
being formed by the rolling operation. On some material, 
the forming operation must be performed by passing the 
material through the rolls several times with progressive 
settings on the forming roll. On most machines, the top roll 
can be released on one end, permitting the formed sheet to 
be removed from the machine without distortion.

The front and rear rolls are grooved to permit forming of 
objects that have wired edges. The upper roll is equipped with 
a release that permits easy removal of the metal after it has 
been formed. When using the slip roll former, the lower front 
roll must be raised or lowered before inserting the sheet of 
metal. If the object has a folded edge, there must be enough 
clearance between the rolls to prevent flattening the fold. If 
a metal requiring special care (such as aluminum) is being 
formed, the rolls must be clean and free of imperfections.

The rear roll must be adjusted to give the proper curvature 
to the part being formed. There are no gauges that indicate 
settings for a specific diameter; therefore, trial and error 
settings must be used to obtain the desired curvature. The 
metal should be inserted between the rolls from the front of 
the machine. Start the metal between the rolls by rotating the 
operating handle in a clockwise direction. A starting edge is 
formed by holding the operating handle firmly with the right 
hand and raising the metal with the left hand. The bend of 
the starting edge is determined by the diameter of the part 
being formed. If the edge of the part is to be flat or nearly 
flat, a starting edge should not be formed.

Ensure that fingers and loose clothing are clear of the rolls 
before the actual forming operation is started. Rotate the 
operating handle until the metal is partially through the rolls 
and change the left hand from the front edge of the sheet to the 
upper edge of the sheet. Then, roll the remainder of the sheet 

through the machine. If the desired curvature is not obtained, 
return the metal to its starting position by rotating the handle 
counterclockwise. Raise or lower the rear roll and roll the 
metal through the rolls again. Repeat this procedure until 
the desired curvature is obtained, then release the upper roll 
and remove the metal. If the part to be formed has a tapered 
shape, the rear roll should be set so that the rolls are closer 
together on one end than on the opposite end. The amount 
of adjustment must be determined by experimentation. If the 
job being formed has a wired edge, the distance between the 
upper and lower rolls and the distance between the lower front 
roll and the rear roll should be slightly greater at the wired 
end than at the opposite end. [Figure 4-61]

Rotary Machine
The rotary machine is used on cylindrical and flat sheet 
metal to shape the edge or to form a bead along the edge. 
[Figure 4-62] Various shaped rolls can be installed on the 
rotary machine to perform these operations. The rotary 
machine works best with thinner annealed materials.

Stretch Forming
In the process of stretch forming, a sheet of metal is shaped 
by stretching it over a formed block to just beyond the elastic 
limit where permanent set takes place with a minimum 
amount of spring-back. To stretch the metal, the sheet is 
rigidly clamped at two opposite edges in fixed vises. Then, the 
metal is stretched by moving a ram that carries the form block 
against the sheet with the pressure from the ram causing the 
material to stretch and wrap to the contour of the form block. 

Stretch forming is normally restricted to relatively large 
parts with large radii of curvature and shallow depth, such as 
contoured skin. Uniform contoured parts produced at a faster 
speed give stretch forming an advantage over hand formed 
parts. Also, the condition of the material is more uniform 
than that obtained by hand forming. 

Drop Hammer
The drop hammer forming process produces shapes by the 
progressive deformation of sheet metal in matched dies under 
the repetitive blows of a gravity-drop hammer or a power-
drop hammer. The configurations most commonly formed 
by the process include shallow, smoothly contoured double-
curvature parts, shallow-beaded parts, and parts with irregular 
and comparatively deep recesses. Small quantities of cup-
shaped and box-shaped parts, curved sections, and contoured 
flanged parts are also formed. Drop hammer forming is not a 
precision forming method and cannot provide tolerances as 
close as 0.03-inch to 0.06-inch. Nevertheless, the process is 
often used for sheet metal parts, such as aircraft components, 
that undergo frequent design changes, or for which there is 
a short run expectancy.

Hydropress Forming
The rubber pad hydropress can be utilized to form many 
varieties of parts from aluminum and its alloys with relative 
ease. Phenolic, masonite, kirksite, and some types of hard 
setting moulding plastic have been used successfully as form 
blocks to press sheet metal parts, such as ribs, spars, fans, 
etc. To perform a press forming operation:

1. Cut a sheet metal blank to size and deburr edges. 

2. Set the form block (normally male) on the lower 
 press platen. 

3. Place the prepared sheet metal blank (with locating 
pins to prevent shifting of the blank when the pressure 
is applied). 

4. Lower or close the rubber pad-filled press head over 
the form block and the rubber envelope. 

5. The form block forces the blank to conform to its 
contour. 

Hydropress forming is usually limited to relatively flat parts 
with flanges, beads, and lightning holes. However, some 
types of large radii contoured parts can be formed by a 
combination of hand forming and pressing operations.

Figure 4-64. English wheel.

Figure 4-65. Piccolo former.

Spin Forming
In spin forming, a flat circle of metal is rotated at a very high 
speed to shape a seamless, hollow part using the combined 
forces of rotation and pressure. For example, a flat circular 
blank such as an aluminum disk, is mounted in a lathe in 
conjunction with a form block (usually made of hardwood). 
As the aircraft technician revolves the disc and form block 
together at high speeds, the disk is molded to the form 
block by applying pressure with a spinning stick or tool. It 
provides an economical alternative to stamping, casting, and 
many other metal forming processes. Propeller spinners are 
sometimes fabricated with this technique.

Aluminum soap, tallow, or ordinary soap can be used as a 
lubricant. The best adapted materials for spinning are the 
softer aluminum alloys, but other alloys can be used if the 
shape to be spun is not excessively deep or if the spinning 
is done in stages utilizing intermediate annealing to remove 
the effect of strain hardening that results from the spinning 
operation. Hot forming is used in some instances when 
spinning thicker and harder alloys. [Figure 4-63] 

Forming with an English Wheel
The English wheel, a popular type of metal forming tool 
used to create double curves in metal, has two steel wheels 
between which metal is formed. [Figure 4-64] Keep in mind 
that the English wheel is primarily a stretching machine, so 
it stretches and thins the metal before forming it into the 
desired shape. Thus, the operator must be careful not to 
over-stretch the metal. 

To use the English wheel, place a piece of sheet metal 
between the wheels (one above and one below the metal). 
Then, roll the wheels against one another under a pre-adjusted 
pressure setting. Steel or aluminum can be shaped by pushing 
the metal back and forth between the wheels. Very little 
pressure is needed to shape the panel, which is stretched or 
raised to the desired shape. It is important to work slowly and 

gradually curve the metal into the desired shape. Monitor the 
curvature with frequent references to the template.

The English wheel is used for shaping low crowns on large 
panels and polishing or planishing (to smooth the surface of a 
metal by rolling or hammering it) parts that have been formed 
with power hammers or hammer and shot bag.

Piccolo Former
The Piccolo former is used for cold forming and rolling sheet 
metal and other profile sections (extrusions). [Figure 4-65] The 
position of the ram is adjustable in height by means of either a 
handwheel or a foot pedal that permits control of the working

pressure. Be sure to utilize the adjusting ring situated in the 
machine head to control the maximum working pressure. The 
forming tools are located in the moving ram and the lower tool 
holder. Depending on the variety of forming tools included, 
the operator can perform such procedures as forming edges, 
bending profiles, removing wrinkles, spot shrinking to remove 
buckles and dents, or expanding dome sheet metal. Available 
in either fiberglass (to prevent marring the surface) or steel 
(for working harder materials) faces, the tools are the quick-
change type.

Shrinking and Stretching Tools
Shrinking Tools
Shrinking dies repeatedly clamp down on the metal, then shift 
inward. [Figure 4-66] This compresses the material between 
the dies, which actually slightly increases the thickness of 
the metal. Strain hardening takes place during this process, 
so it is best to set the working pressure high enough to 
complete the shape rather quickly (eight passes could be  
considered excessive).

CAUTION: Avoid striking a die on the radius itself when 
forming a curved flange. This damages the metal in the radius 
and decreases the angle of bend.

Stretching Tools
Stretching dies repeatedly clamp down on the surface and 
then shift outward. This stretches the metal between the dies, 
which decreases the thickness in the stretched area. Striking 
the same point too many times weakens and eventually cracks 
the part. It is advantageous to deburr or even polish the edges 
of a flange that must undergo even moderate stretching to 
avoid crack formation. Forming flanges with existing holes 
causes the holes to distort and possibly crack or substantially 
weaken the flange.

Manual Foot-Operated Sheet Metal Shrinker
The manual foot-operated sheet metal shrinker operates very 
similarly to the Piccolo former though it only has two primary 

functions: shrinking and stretching. The only dies available 
are steel faced and therefore tend to mar the surface of the 
metal. When used on aluminum, it is necessary to gently 
blend out the surface irregularities (primarily in the cladding), 
then treat and paint the part.

Since this is a manual machine, it relies on leg power, as the 
operator repeatedly steps on the foot pedal. The more force 
is applied, the more stresses are concentrated at that single 
point. It yields a better part with a series of smaller stretches 
(or shrinks) than with a few intense ones. Squeezing the dies 
over the radius damages the metal and flattens out some of 
the bend. It may be useful to tape a thick piece of plastic or 
micarta to the opposite leg to shim the radius of the angle 
away from the clamping area of the dies.

NOTE: Watch the part change shape while slowly applying 
pressure. A number of small stretches works more effectively 
than one large one. If applying too much pressure, the metal 
has the tendency to buckle. 

Hand-Operated Shrinker and Stretcher
The hand-operated shrinker and stretcher is similar to the 
manual foot-operated unit, except a handle is used to apply 
force to shrinking and stretching blocks. The dies are all 
metal and leave marks on aluminum that need to be blended 
out after the shrinking or stretching operation. [Figure 4-67]

Dollies and Stakes
Sheet metal is often formed or finished (planished) over 
anvils, available in a variety of shapes and sizes, called 
dollies and stakes. These are used for forming small, odd-
shaped parts, or for putting on finishing touches for which 
a large machine may not be suited. Dollies are meant to be 
held in the hand, whereas stakes are designed to be supported 
by a flat cast iron bench plate fastened to the workbench. 
[Figure 4-68]


4-28

Figure 4-69. Sheet metal mallet and hammers.

Figure 4-68. Dollies and stakes.

Most stakes have machined, polished surfaces that have been 
hardened. Use of stakes to back up material when chiseling, 
or when using any similar cutting tool, defaces the surface 
of the stake and makes it useless for finish work.

Hardwood Form Blocks
Hardwood form blocks can be constructed to duplicate 
practically any aircraft structural or nonstructural part. The 
wooden block or form is shaped to the exact dimensions and 
contour of the part to be formed.

V-Blocks
V-blocks made of hardwood are widely used in airframe 
metalwork for shrinking and stretching metal, particularly 
angles and flanges. The size of the block depends on the work 
being done and on personal preference. Although any type 
of hardwood is suitable, maple and ash are recommended for 
best results when working with aluminum alloys.

Shrinking Blocks
A shrinking block consists of two metal blocks and some 
device for clamping them together. One block forms the 
base and the other is cut away to provide space where the 
crimped material can be hammered. The legs of the upper 
jaw clamp the material to the base block on each side of 

the crimp to prevent the material from creeping away, but 
remains stationary while the crimp is hammered flat (being 
shrunk). This type of crimping block is designed to be held 
in a bench vise.

Shrinking blocks can be made to fit any specific need. The 
basic form and principle remain the same, even though the 
blocks may vary considerably in size and shape.

Sandbags
A sandbag is generally used as a support during the bumping 
process. A serviceable bag can be made by sewing heavy 
canvas or soft leather to form a bag of the desired size, and 
filling it with sand which has been sifted through a fine  
mesh screen.

Before filling canvas bags with sand, use a brush to coat the 
inside of the bag with softened paraffin or beeswax, which 
forms a sealing layer and prevents the sand from working 
through the pores of the canvas. Bags can also be filled with 
shot as an alternative to sand.

Sheet Metal Hammers and Mallets
The sheet metal hammer and the mallet are metal fabrication 
hand tools used for bending and forming sheet metal without 
marring or indenting the metal. The hammer head is usually 
made of high carbon, heat-treated steel, while the head of the 
mallet, which is usually larger than that of the hammer, is 
made of rubber, plastic, wood, or leather. In combination with 
a sandbag, V-blocks, and dies, sheet metal body hammers 
and mallets are used to form annealed metal. [Figure 4-69]

Sheet Metal Holding Devices
In order to work with sheet metal during the fabrication 
process, the aviation technician uses a variety of holding 
devices, such as clamps, vises, and fasteners to hold the 
work together. The type of operation being performed and

Figure 4-71. A utility vise with swivel base and anvil.

Figure 4-72. Cleco fastener.

the type of metal being used determine what type of the 
holding device is needed.

Clamps and Vises 
Clamps and vises hold materials in place when it is not 
possible to handle a tool and the workpiece at the same 
time. A clamp is a fastening device with movable jaws that 
has opposing, often adjustable, sides or parts. An essential 
fastening device, it holds objects tightly together to prevent 
movement or separation. Clamps can be either temporary 
or permanent. Temporary clamps, such as the carriage 
clamp (commonly called the C-clamp), are used to position 
components while fixing them together.

C-Clamps
The C-clamp is shaped like a large C and has three main 
parts: threaded screw, jaw, and swivel head. [Figure 4-70]
The swivel plate or flat end of the screw prevents the end from 
turning directly against the material being clamped. C-clamp 
size is measured by the dimension of the largest object the 
frame can accommodate with the screw fully extended. 
The distance from the center line of the screw to the inside 
edge of the frame or the depth of throat is also an important 
consideration when using this clamp. C-clamps vary in size 
from two inches upward. Since C-clamps can leave marks 
on aluminum, protect the aircraft covering with masking tape 
at the places where the C-clamp is used.

Vises
Vises are another clamping device that hold the workpiece 
in place and allow work to be done on it with tools such as 
saws and drills. The vise consists of two fixed or adjustable 
jaws that are opened or closed by a screw or a lever. The size 
of a vise is measured by both the jaw width and the capacity 
of the vise when the jaws are fully open. Vises also depend 
on a screw to apply pressure, but their textured jaws enhance 
gripping ability beyond that of a clamp. 

Two of the most commonly used vises are the machinist’s 
vise and the utility vise. [Figure 4-71] The machinist’s 
vise has flat jaws and usually a swivel base, whereas the 
utility bench vise has scored, removable jaws and an anvil-
faced back jaw. This vise holds heavier material than the 
machinist’s vise and also grips pipe or rod firmly. The back 
jaw can be used as an anvil if the work being done is light. 
To avoid marring metal in the vise jaws, add some type of 
padding, such as a ready-made rubber jaw pad.

Reusable Sheet Metal Fasteners
Reusable sheet metal fasteners temporarily hold drilled sheet 
metal parts accurately in position for riveting or drilling. If 
sheet metal parts are not held tightly together, they separate 
while being riveted or drilled. The Cleco (also spelled Cleko) 
fastener is the most commonly used sheet metal holder. 
[Figure 4-72] 


4-30

Figure 4-73. Hex nut fastener.

Cleco Fasteners
The Cleco fastener consists of a steel cylinder body with a 
plunger on the top, a spring, a pair of step-cut locks, and a 
spreader bar. These fasteners come in six different sizes: 3⁄32, 
1⁄8, 5⁄32, 3⁄16, 1⁄4, and 3⁄8-inch in diameter with the size stamped on 
the fastener. Color coding allows for easy size recognition. A 
special type of plier fits the six different sizes. When installed 
correctly, the reusable Cleco fastener keeps the holes in the 
separate sheets aligned.

Hex Nut and Wing Nut Temporary Sheet Fasteners
Hex nut and wing nut fasteners are used to temporarily fasten 
sheets of metal when higher clamp up pressure is required. 
[Figure 4-73] Hex nut fasteners provide up to 300 pounds 
of clamping force with the advantage of quick installation 
and removal with a hex nut runner. Wing nut sheet metal 
fasteners, characterized by wing shaped protrusions, not only 
provide a consistent clamping force from 0 to 300 pounds, but 
the aircraft technician can turn and tighten these fasteners by 
hand. Cleco hex nut fasteners are identical to Cleco wing nut 
fasteners, but the Cleco hex nut can be used with pneumatic 
Cleco installers.

Aluminum Alloys
Aluminum alloys are the most frequently encountered type 
of sheet metal in aircraft repair. AC 43.13-1 Chapter 4, Metal 
Structure, Welding, and Brazing; Section 1, Identification 
of Metals (as revised) provides an in-depth discussion of 
all metal types. This section describes the aluminum alloys 
used in the forming processes discussed in the remainder of 
the chapter. 

In its pure state, aluminum is lightweight, lustrous, and 
corrosion resistant. The thermal conductivity of aluminum 
is very high. It is ductile, malleable, and nonmagnetic. When 
combined with various percentages of other metals (generally 
copper, manganese, and magnesium), aluminum alloys that 
are used in aircraft construction are formed. Aluminum 
alloys are lightweight and strong. They do not possess the 
corrosion resistance of pure aluminum and are usually treated 

to prevent deterioration. Alclad™ aluminum is an aluminum 
alloy with a protective cladding of aluminum to improve its 
corrosion resistance.

To provide a visual means for identifying the various 
grades of aluminum and aluminum alloys, aluminum stock 
is usually marked with symbols such as a Government 
Specification Number, the temper or condition furnished, 
or the commercial code marking. Plate and sheet are usually 
marked with specification numbers or code markings in 
rows approximately five inches apart. Tubes, bars, rods, 
and extruded shapes are marked with specification numbers 
or code markings at intervals of three to five feet along the 
length of each piece.

The commercial code marking consists of a number 
that identifies the particular composition of the alloy. 
Additionally, letter suffixes designate the basic temper 
designations and subdivisions of aluminum alloys.

The aluminum and various aluminum alloys used in aircraft 
repair and construction are as follows:

• Aluminum designated by the symbol 1100 is used 
where strength is not an important factor, but where 
weight economy and corrosion resistance are desired. 
This aluminum is used for fuel tanks, cowlings, and oil 
tanks. It is also used for repairing wingtips and tanks. 
This material is weldable.

• Alloy 3003 is similar to 1100 and is generally used 
for the same purposes. It contains a small percentage 
of magnesium and is stronger and harder than  
1100 aluminum.

• Alloy 2014 is used for heavy-duty forgings, plates, 
extrusions for aircraft fittings, wheels, and major 
structural components. This alloy is often used for 
applications requiring high strength and hardness, as 
well as for service at elevated temperatures.

• Alloy 2017 is used for rivets. This material is now in 
limited use.

• Alloy 2024, with or without Alclad™ coating, is 
used for aircraft structures, rivets, hardware, machine 
screw products, and other miscellaneous structural 
applications. In addition, this alloy is commonly 
used for heat-treated parts, airfoil and fuselage skins, 
extrusions, and fittings.

• Alloy 2025 is used extensively for propeller blades.

• Alloy 2219 is used for fuel tanks, aircraft skin, and 
structural components. This material has high fracture 
toughness and is readily weldable. Alloy 2219 is also 
highly resistant to stress corrosion cracking.

Countersunk head Universal head

Figure 4-74. Solid shank rivet styles. 

• Alloy 5052 is used where good workability, very 
good corrosion resistance, high fatigue strength, 
weldability, and moderate static strength are desired. 
This alloy is used for fuel, hydraulic, and oil lines.

• Alloy 5056 is used for making rivets and cable 
sheeting and in applications where aluminum comes 
into contact with magnesium alloys. Alloy 5056 
is generally resistant to the most common forms  
of corrosion.

• Cast aluminum alloys are used for cylinder 
heads, crankcases, fuel injectors, carburetors, and  
landing wheels.

• Various alloys, including 3003, 5052, and 1100 
aluminum, are hardened by cold working rather than 
by heat treatment. Other alloys, including 2017 and 
2024, are hardened by heat treatment, cold working, 
or a combination of the two. Various casting alloys 
are hardened by heat treatment.

• Alloy 6061 is generally weldable by all commercial 
procedures and methods. It also maintains acceptable 
toughness in many cryogenic applications. Alloy 6061 
is easily extruded and is commonly used for hydraulic 
and pneumatic tubing.

• Although higher in strength than 2024, alloy 7075 
has a lower fracture toughness and is generally used 
in tension applications where fatigue is not critical. 
The T6 temper of 7075 should be avoided in corrosive 
environments. However, the T7351 temper of 7075 
has excellent stress corrosion resistance and better 
fracture toughness than the T6 temper. The T76 temper 
is often used to improve the resistance of 7075 to 
exfoliate corrosion.

Structural Fasteners 
Structural fasteners, used to join sheet metal structures 
securely, come in thousands of shapes and sizes with many 
of them specialized and specific to certain aircraft. Since 
some structural fasteners are common to all aircraft, this 
section focuses on the more frequently used fasteners. For 
the purposes of this discussion, fasteners are divided into two 
main groups: solid shank rivets and special purpose fasteners 
that include blind rivets.  

Solid Shank Rivet 
The solid shank rivet is the most common type of rivet used 
in aircraft construction. Used to join aircraft structures, solid 
shank rivets are one of the oldest and most reliable types of 
fastener. Widely used in the aircraft manufacturing industry, 
solid shank rivets are relatively low-cost, permanently 
installed fasteners. They are faster to install than bolts 
and nuts since they adapt well to automatic, high-speed 

installation tools. Rivets should not be used in thick materials 
or in tensile applications, as their tensile strengths are quite 
low relative to their shear strength. The longer the total grip 
length (the total thickness of sheets being joined), the more 
difficult it becomes to lock the rivet. 

Riveted joints are neither airtight nor watertight unless special 
seals or coatings are used. Since rivets are permanently 
installed, they must be removed by drilling them out, a 
laborious task.

Description
Before installation, the rivet consists of a smooth cylindrical 
shaft with a factory head on one end. The opposite end is 
called the bucktail. To secure two or more pieces of sheet 
metal together, the rivet is placed into a hole cut just a bit 
larger in diameter than the rivet itself. Once placed in this 
predrilled hole, the bucktail is upset or deformed by any of 
several methods from hand-held hammers to pneumatically 
driven squeezing tools. This action causes the rivet to expand 
about 11⁄2 times the original shaft diameter, forming a second 
head that firmly holds the material in place.

Rivet Head Shape

Solid rivets are available in several head shapes, but the 
universal and the 100° countersunk head are the most 
commonly used in aircraft structures. Universal head rivets 
were developed specifically for the aircraft industry and 
designed as a replacement for both the round and brazier head 
rivets. These rivets replaced all protruding head rivets and are 
used primarily where the protruding head has no aerodynamic 
significant. They have a flat area on the head, a head diameter 
twice the shank diameter, and a head height approximately 
42.5 percent of the shank diameter. [Figure 4-74]  

The countersunk head angle can vary from 60° to 120°, but 
the 100° has been adopted as standard because this head style 
provides the best possible compromise between tension/
shear strength and flushness requirements. This rivet is used 
where flushness is required because the rivet is flat-topped 
and undercut to allow the head to fit into a countersunk or 
dimpled hole. The countersunk rivet is primarily intended

for use when aerodynamics smoothness is critical, such as 
on the external surface of a high-speed aircraft. 

Typically, rivets are fabricated from aluminum alloys, such 
as 2017-T4, 2024-T4, 2117-T4, 7050, and 5056. Titanium, 
nickel-based alloys, such as Monel® (corrosion-resistant 
steel), mild steel or iron, and copper rivets are also used for 
rivets in certain cases. 

Rivets are available in a wide variety of alloys, head shapes, 
and sizes and have a wide variety of uses in aircraft structure. 
Rivets that are satisfactory for one part of the aircraft are often 
unsatisfactory for another part. Therefore, it is important 
that an aircraft technician know the strength and driving 
properties of the various types of rivets and how to identify 
them, as well as how to drive or install them.

Solid rivets are classified by their head shape, by the material 
from which they are manufactured, and by their size. 
Identification codes used are derived from a combination of 
the Military Standard (MS) and National Aerospace Standard 
(NAS) systems, as well as an older classification system 
known as AN for Army/Navy. For example, the prefix MS 
identifies hardware that conforms to written military standards. 
A letter or letters following the head-shaped code identify the 
material or alloy from which the rivet was made. The alloy 
code is followed by two numbers separated by a dash. The 
first number is the numerator of a fraction, which specifies 
the shank diameter in thirty-seconds of an inch. The second 
number is the numerator of a fraction in sixteenths of an inch 
and identifies the length of the rivet. Rivet head shapes and 
their identifying code numbers are shown in Figure 4-75.

The most frequently used repair rivet is the AD rivet because 
it can be installed in the received condition. Some rivet alloys, 
such as DD rivets (alloy 2024-T4), are too hard to drive in the 
received condition and must be annealed before they can be 
installed. Typically, these rivets are annealed and stored in 
a freezer to retard hardening, which has led to the nickname 

“ice box rivets.” They are removed from the freezer just prior 
to use. Most DD rivets have been replaced by E-type rivets 
which can be installed in the received condition.

The head type, size, and strength required in a rivet are 
governed by such factors as the kind of forces present at the 
point riveted, the kind and thickness of the material to be 
riveted, and the location of the part on the aircraft. The type 
of head needed for a particular job is determined by where 
it is to be installed. Countersunk head rivets should be used 
where a smooth aerodynamic surface is required. Universal 
head rivets may be used in most other areas.

The size (or diameter) of the selected rivet shank should 
correspond in general to the thickness of the material being 
riveted. If an excessively large rivet is used in a thin material, 
the force necessary to drive the rivet properly causes an 
undesirable bulging around the rivet head. On the other hand, 
if an excessively small rivet diameter is selected for thick 
material, the shear strength of the rivet is not great enough 
to carry the load of the joint. As a general rule, the rivet 
diameter should be at least two and a half to three times the 
thickness of the thicker sheet. Rivets most commonly chosen 
in the assembly and repair of aircraft range from 3⁄32-inch 
to 3⁄8-inch in diameter. Ordinarily, rivets smaller than 3⁄32-
inch in diameter are never used on any structural parts that  
carry stresses.

The proper sized rivets to use for any repair can also 
be determined by referring to the rivets (used by the 
manufacturer) in the next parallel row inboard on the wing 
or forward on the fuselage. Another method of determining 
the size of rivets to be used is to multiply the skin’s thickness 
by 3 and use the next larger size rivet corresponding to that 
figure. For example, if the skin is 0.040 inch thick, multiply 
0.040 inch by 3 to get 0.120 inch and use the next larger size 
of rivet, 1⁄8-inch (0.125 inch).

When rivets are to pass completely through tubular members, 
select a rivet diameter equivalent to at least 1⁄8 the outside 
diameter of the tube. If one tube sleeves or fits over another, 
take the outside diameter of the outside tube and use one-
eighth of that distance as the minimum rivet diameter. A good 
practice is to calculate the minimum rivet diameter and then 
use the next larger size rivet.

Whenever possible, select rivets of the same alloy number 
as the material being riveted. For example, use 1100 and 
3003 rivets on parts fabricated from 1100 and 3003 alloys, 
and 2117-1 and 2017-T rivets on parts fabricated from 2017 
and 2024 alloys.

Installation of Rivets
Repair Layout

Repair layout involves determining the number of rivets 
required, the proper size and style of rivets to be used, their 
material, temper condition and strength, the size of the holes, 
the distances between the holes, and the distance between 
the holes and the edges of the patch. Distances are measured 
in terms of rivet diameter.

Rivet Length 

To determine the total length of a rivet to be installed, the 
combined thickness of the materials to be joined must first 
be known. This measurement is known as the grip length. 
The total length of the rivet equals the grip length plus the 
amount of rivet shank needed to form a proper shop head. 
The latter equals one and a half times the diameter of the rivet 
shank. Where A is total rivet length, B is grip length, and 
C is the length of the material needed to form a shop head, 
this formula can be represented as A = B + C. [Figure 4-76]

Rivet Strength

For structural applications, the strength of the replacement 
rivets is of primary importance. [Figure 4-77] Rivets made 
of material that is lower in strength should not be used as 

replacements unless the shortfall is made up by using a larger 
rivet. For example, a rivet of 2024-T4 aluminum alloy should 
not be replaced with one of 2117-T4 or 2017-T4 aluminum 
alloy unless the next larger size is used. 

The 2117-T rivet is used for general repair work, since it 
requires no heat treatment, is fairly soft and strong, and is 
highly corrosion resistant when used with most types of 
alloys. Always consult the maintenance manual for correct 
rivet type and material. The type of rivet head to select for 
a particular repair job can be determined by referring to the 
type used within the surrounding area by the manufacturer.

A general rule to follow on a flush-riveted aircraft is to apply 
flush rivets on the upper surface of the wing and stabilizers, 
on the lower leading edge back to the spar, and on the fuselage 
back to the high point of the wing. Use universal head rivets 
in all other surface areas. Whenever possible, select rivets of 
the same alloy number as the material being riveted.

Stresses Applied to Rivets

Shear is one of the two stresses applied to rivets. The shear 
strength is the amount of force required to cut a rivet that 
holds two or more sheets of material together. If the rivet 
holds two parts, it is under single shear; if it holds three 
sheets or parts, it is under double shear. To determine the 
shear strength, the diameter of the rivet to be used must be 
found by multiplying the thickness of the skin material by 3. 
For example, a material thickness of 0.040 inch multiplied by 
3 equals 0.120 inch. In this case, the rivet diameter selected 
would be 1⁄8 (0.125) inch.
 

Tension is the other stress applied to rivets. The resistance to 
tension is called bearing strength and is the amount of tension 
required to pull a rivet through the edge of two sheets riveted 
together or to elongate the hole. 

Rivet Spacing

Rivet spacing is measured between the centerlines of rivets 
in the same row. The minimum spacing between protruding 
head rivets shall not be less than 31⁄2 times the rivet diameter. 
The minimum spacing between flush head rivets shall not be 
less than 4 times the diameter of the rivet. These dimensions 
may be used as the minimum spacing except when specified 
differently in a specific repair procedure or when replacing 
existing rivets. 

On most repairs, the general practice is to use the same rivet 
spacing and edge distance (distance from the center of the 
hole to the edge of the material) that the manufacturer used in 
the area surrounding the damage. The SRM for the particular 
aircraft may also be consulted. Aside from this fundamental 
rule, there is no specific set of rules that governs spacing 
of rivets in all cases. However, there are certain minimum 
requirements that must be observed.

• When possible, rivet edge distance, rivet spacing, and 
distance between rows should be the same as that of 
the original installation.

• When new sections are to be added, the edge distance 
measured from the center of the rivet should never be 
less than 2 times the diameter of the shank; the distance 
between rivets or pitch should be at least 3 times the 
diameter; and the distance between rivet rows should 
never be less than 21⁄2 times the diameter.

Figure 4-78 illustrates acceptable ways of laying out a rivet 
pattern for a repair.

Edge Distance

Edge distance, also called edge margin by some manufacturers, 
is the distance from the center of the first rivet to the edge 
of the sheet. It should not be less than 2 or more than 4 rivet 
diameters and the recommended edge distance is about 21⁄2 
rivet diameters. The minimum edge distance for universal 
rivets is 2 times the diameter of the rivet; the minimum edge 
distance for countersunk rivets is 21⁄2 times the diameter of the 
rivet. If rivets are placed too close to the edge of the sheet, 
the sheet may crack or pull away from the rivets. If they are 
spaced too far from the edge, the sheet is likely to turn up at 
the edges. [Figure 4-79]

It is good practice to lay out the rivets a little further from the 
edge so that the rivet holes can be oversized without violating

the edge distance minimums. Add 1⁄16-inch to the minimum 
edge distance or determine the edge distance using the next 
size of rivet diameter. 

Two methods for obtaining edge distance: 

• The rivet diameter of a protruding head rivet is 3⁄32-
inch. Multiply 2 times 3⁄32-inch to obtain the minimum 
edge distance, 3⁄16-inch, add 1⁄16-inch to yield the 
preferred edge distance of 1⁄4-inch. 

• The rivet diameter of a protruding head rivet is 3⁄32-inch. 
Select the next size of rivet, which is 1⁄8-inch. Calculate 
the edge distance by multiplying 2 times 1⁄8-inch to get 
1⁄4-inch. 

Rivet Pitch

Rivet pitch is the distance between the centers of neighboring 
rivets in the same row. The smallest allowable rivet pitch is 3 
rivet diameters. The average rivet pitch usually ranges from 
4 to 6 rivet diameters, although in some instances rivet pitch 
could be as large as 10 rivet diameters. Rivet spacing on parts 
that are subjected to bending moments is often closer to the 
minimum spacing to prevent buckling of the skin between 
the rivets. The minimum pitch also depends on the number of 
rows of rivets. One-and three-row layouts have a minimum 
pitch of 3 rivet diameters, a two-row layout has a minimum 
pitch of 4 rivet diameters. The pitch for countersunk rivets 
is larger than for universal head rivets. If the rivet spacing 
is made at least 1⁄16-inch larger than the minimum, the rivet 
hole can be oversized without violating the minimum rivet 
spacing requirement. [Figure 4-80]

Transverse Pitch

Transverse pitch is the perpendicular distance between rivet 
rows. It is usually 75 percent of the rivet pitch. The smallest 
allowable transverse pitch is 21⁄2 rivet diameters. The smallest 
allowable transverse pitch is 21⁄2 rivet diameters. Rivet pitch 
and transverse pitch often have the same dimension and are 
simply called rivet spacing.

Rivet Layout Example

The general rules for rivet spacing, as it is applied to a 
straight-row layout, are quite simple. In a one-row layout, 
find the edge distance at each end of the row and then lay 

off the rivet pitch (distance between rivets), as shown in 
Figure 4-81. In a two-row layout, lay off the first row, place 
the second row a distance equal to the transverse pitch from 
the first row, and then lay off rivet spots in the second row 
so that they fall midway between those in the first row. In the 
three-row layout, first lay off the first and third rows, then 
use a straightedge to determine the second row rivet spots.

When splicing a damaged tube, and the rivets pass completely 
through the tube, space the rivets four to seven rivet diameters 
apart if adjacent rivets are at right angles to each other, and 
space them five to seven rivet diameters apart if the rivets 
are parallel to each other. The first rivet on each side of the 
joint should be no less than 21⁄2 rivet diameters from the end 
of the sleeve.

Rivet Installation Tools
The various tools needed in the normal course of driving 
and upsetting rivets include drills, reamers, rivet cutters or 
nippers, bucking bars, riveting hammers, draw sets, dimpling 
dies or other types of countersinking equipment, rivet guns, 
and squeeze riveters. C-clamps, vises, and other fasteners 
used to hold sheets together when riveting were discussed 
earlier in the chapter. Other tools and equipment needed in the 
installation of rivets are discussed in the following paragraphs.

Hand Tools

A variety of hand tools are used in the normal course of 
driving and upsetting rivets. They include rivet cutters, 
bucking bars, hand riveters, countersinks, and dimpling tools.

Rivet Cutter

The rivet cutter is used to trim rivets when rivets of the 
required length are unavailable. [Figure 4-82] To use the 
rotary rivet cutter, insert the rivet in the correct hole, place the 
required number of shims under the rivet head, and squeeze 
the cutter as if it were a pair of pliers. Rotation of the disks 
cuts the rivet to give the right length, which is determined 
by the number of shims inserted under the head. When using 
a large rivet cutter, place it in a vise, insert the rivet in the 
proper hole, and cut by pulling the handle, which shears off 
the rivet. If regular rivet cutters are not available, diagonal 
cutting pliers can be used as a substitute cutter.

Bucking Bar

The bucking bar, sometimes called a dolly, bucking 
iron, or bucking block, is a heavy chunk of steel whose 
countervibration during installation contributes to proper 
rivet installation. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, 
and their weights ranges from a few ounces to 8 or 10 pounds, 
depending upon the nature of the work. Bucking bars are 
most often made from low-carbon steel that has been case 
hardened or alloy bar stock. Those made of better grades of 
steel last longer and require less reconditioning. 

Bucking faces must be hard enough to resist indentation and 
remain smooth, but not hard enough to shatter. Sometimes, 
the more complicated bars must be forged or built up by 
welding. The bar usually has a concave face to conform to the 
shape of the shop head to be made. When selecting a bucking 
bar, the first consideration is shape. [Figure 4-83] If the bar 
does not have the correct shape, it deforms the rivet head; 
if the bar is too light, it does not give the necessary bucking 
weight, and the material may become bulged toward the shop 
head. If the bar is too heavy, its weight and the bucking force 
may cause the material to bulge away from the shop head. 

This tool is used by holding it against the shank end of a rivet 
while the shop head is being formed. Always hold the face 
of the bucking bar at right angles to the rivet shank. Failure 
to do so causes the rivet shank to bend with the first blows 
of the rivet gun and causes the material to become marred 
with the final blows. The bucker must hold the bucking bar 
in place until the rivet is completely driven. If the bucking 
bar is removed while the gun is in operation, the rivet set 
may be driven through the material. Allow the weight of the 
bucking bar to do most of the work and do not bear down 
too heavily on the shank of the rivet. The operator’s hands 
merely guide the bar and supply the necessary tension and 
rebound action. Coordinated bucking allows the bucking bar 
to vibrate in unison with the gun set. With experience, a high 
degree of skill can be developed.

Defective rivet heads can be caused by lack of proper 
vibrating action, the use of a bucking bar that is too light or 
too heavy, and failure to hold the bucking bar at right angles 
to the rivet. The bars must be kept clean, smooth, and well 
polished. Their edges should be slightly rounded to prevent 
marring the material surrounding the riveting operation. 

Hand Rivet Set

A hand rivet set is a tool equipped with a die for driving a 
particular type rivet. Rivet sets are available to fit every size 
and shape of rivet head. The ordinary set is made of 1⁄2-inch

carbon tool steel about 6 inches in length and is knurled 
to prevent slipping in the hand. Only the face of the set is 
hardened and polished.

Sets for universal rivets are recessed (or cupped) to fit the 
rivet head. In selecting the correct set, be sure it provides the 
proper clearance between the set and the sides of the rivet 
head and between the surfaces of the metal and the set. Flush 
or flat sets are used for countersunk and flathead rivets. To 
seat flush rivets properly, be sure that the flush sets are at 
least 1 inch in diameter.

Special draw sets are used to draw up the sheets to eliminate 
any opening between them before the rivet is bucked. Each 
draw set has a hole 1⁄32-inch larger than the diameter of the 
rivet shank for which it is made. Occasionally, the draw set 
and rivet header are incorporated into one tool. The header 
part consists of a hole shallow enough for the set to expand 
the rivet and head when struck with a hammer.

Countersinking Tool

The countersink is a tool that cuts a cone-shaped depression 
around the rivet hole to allow the rivet to set flush with 
the surface of the skin. Countersinks are made with angles 
to correspond with the various angles of countersunk 
rivet heads. The standard countersink has a 100º angle, 
as shown in Figure 4-84. Special microstop countersinks 
(commonly called stop countersinks) are available that can 
be adjusted to any desired depth and have cutters to allow 
interchangeable holes with various countersunk angles to 
be made. [Figure 4-85] Some stop countersinks also have 
a micrometer set mechanism, in 0.001-inch increments, for 
adjusting their cutting depths. 

Dimpling Dies

Dimpling is done with a male and female die (punch and die 
set). The male die has a guide the size of the rivet hole and 
with the same degree of countersink as the rivet. The female 
die has a hole with a corresponding degree of countersink 
into which the male guide fits.

Power Tools

The most common power tools used in riveting are the 
pneumatic rivet gun, rivet squeezers, and the microshaver.

Pneumatic Rivet Gun

The pneumatic rivet gun is the most common rivet 
upsetting tool used in airframe repair work. It is available 
in many sizes and types. [Figure 4-86] The manufacturer’s 
recommended capacity for each gun is usually stamped on 
the barrel. Pneumatic guns operate on air pressure of 90 
to 100 pounds per square inch and are used in conjunction 
with interchangeable rivet sets. Each set is designed to fit 
the specific type of rivet and the location of the work. The 
shank of the set is designed to fit into the rivet gun. An air-
driven hammer inside the barrel of the gun supplies force to 
buck the rivet.

Slow hitting rivet guns that strike from 900 to 2,500 blows 
per minute are the most common type. [Figure 4-87] These 
blows are slow enough to be easily controlled and heavy 
enough to do the job. These guns are sized by the largest rivet 
size continuously driven with size often based on the Chicago 
Pneumatic Company’s old “X” series. A 4X gun (dash 8 or 1⁄4

rivet) is used for normal work. The less powerful 3X gun is 
used for smaller rivets in thinner structure. 7X guns are used 
for large rivets in thicker structures. A rivet gun should upset  
a rivet in 1 to 3 seconds. With practice, an aircraft technician 
learns the length of time needed to hold down the trigger. 

A rivet gun with the correct header (rivet set) must be held 
snugly against the rivet head and perpendicular to the surface 
while a bucking bar of the proper weight is held against the 
opposite end. The force of the gun must be absorbed by the 
bucking bar and not the structure being riveted. When the 
gun is triggered, the rivet is driven. 

Always make sure the correct rivet header and the retaining 
spring are installed. Test the rivet gun on a piece of wood 
and adjust the air valve to a setting that is comfortable for 
the operator. The driving force of the rivet gun is adjusted by 
a needle valve on the handle. Adjustments should never be 
tested against anything harder than a wooden block to avoid 
header damage. If the adjustment fails to provide the best 
driving force, a different sized gun is needed. A gun that is 
too powerful is hard to control and may damage the work. 

On the other hand, if the gun is too light, it may work harden 
the rivet before the head can be fully formed.

The riveting action should start slowly and be one continued 
burst. If the riveting starts too fast, the rivet header might 
slip off the rivet and damage the rivet (smiley) or damage 
the skin (eyebrow). Try to drive the rivets within 3 seconds, 
because the rivet will work harden if the driving process 
takes too long. The dynamic of the driving process has the 
gun hitting, or vibrating, the rivet and material, which causes 
the bar to bounce, or countervibrate. These opposing blows 
(low frequency vibrations) squeeze the rivet, causing it to 
swell and then form the upset head. 

Some precautions to be observed when using a rivet gun are:

1. Never point a rivet gun at anyone at any time. A rivet 
gun should be used for one purpose only: to drive or 
install rivets.

2. Never depress the trigger mechanism unless the set is 
held tightly against a block of wood or a rivet.

3. Always disconnect the air hose from the rivet gun 
when it is not in use for any appreciable length of time.

While traditional tooling has changed little in the past 60 
years, significant changes have been made in rivet gun 
ergonomics. Reduced vibration rivet guns and bucking bars 
have been developed to reduce the incidence of carpal tunnel 
syndrome and enhance operator comfort. 

Rivet Sets/Headers

Pneumatic guns are used in conjunction with interchangeable 
rivet sets or headers. Each is designed to fit the type of rivet 
and location of the work. The shank of the rivet header is 
designed to fit into the rivet gun. An appropriate header must 
be a correct match for the rivet being driven. The working 
face of a header should be properly designed and smoothly 
polished. They are made of forged steel, heat treated to be 
tough but not too brittle. Flush headers come in various sizes. 
Smaller ones concentrate the driving force in a small area for 
maximum efficiency. Larger ones spread the driving force 
over a larger area and are used for the riveting of thin skins.

Nonflush headers should fit to contact about the center two-
thirds of the rivet head. They must be shallow enough to allow 
slight upsetting of the head in driving and some misalignment 
without eyebrowing the riveted surface. Care must be taken to 
match the size of the rivet. A header that is too small marks 
the rivet; while one too large marks the material.

Rivet headers are made in a variety of styles. [Figure 4-88] The 
short, straight header is best when the gun can be brought 
close to the work. Offset headers may be used to reach rivets 
in obstructed places. Long headers are sometimes necessary 
when the gun cannot be brought close to the work due to 
structural interference. Rivet headers should be kept clean.

Compression Riveting

Compression riveting (squeezing) is of limited value because 
this method of riveting can be used only over the edges of 
sheets or assemblies where conditions permit, and where the 
reach of the rivet squeezer is deep enough. The three types 

of rivet squeezers—hand, pneumatic, and pneudraulic—
operate on the same principles. In the hand rivet squeezer, 
compression is supplied by hand pressure; in the pneumatic 
rivet squeezer, by air pressure; and in the pneudraulic, 
by a combination of air and hydraulic pressure. One jaw 
is stationary and serves as a bucking bar, the other jaw is 
movable and does the upsetting. Riveting with a squeezer is 
a quick method and requires only one operator.

These riveters are equipped with either a C-yoke or an 
alligator yoke in various sizes to accommodate any size of 
rivet. The working capacity of a yoke is measured by its gap 
and its reach. The gap is the distance between the movable 
jaw and the stationary jaw; the reach is the inside length 
of the throat measured from the center of the end sets. End 
sets for rivet squeezers serve the same purpose as rivet sets 
for pneumatic rivet guns and are available with the same 
type heads, which are interchangeable to suit any type of 
rivet head. One part of each set is inserted in the stationary 
jaw, while the other part is placed in the movable jaws. 
The manufactured head end set is placed on the stationary 
jaw whenever possible. During some operations, it may be 
necessary to reverse the end sets, placing the manufactured 
head end set on the movable jaw.

Microshavers

A microshaver is used if the smoothness of the material (such 
as skin) requires that all countersunk rivets be driven within 
a specific tolerance. [Figure 4-89] This tool has a cutter, a 
stop, and two legs or stabilizers. The cutting portion of the 
microshaver is inside the stop. The depth of the cut can be 
adjusted by pulling outward on the stop and turning it in 
either direction (clockwise for deeper cuts). The marks on 
the stop permit adjustments of 0.001 inch. If the microshaver 
is adjusted and held correctly, it can cut the head of a 
countersunk rivet to within 0.002 inch without damaging 
the surrounding material.

Adjustments should always be made first on scrap material. 
When correctly adjusted, the microshaver leaves a small 
round dot about the size of a pinhead on the microshaved 
rivet. It may occasionally be necessary to shave rivets, 
normally restricted to MS20426 head rivets, after driving 
to obtain the required flushness. Shear head rivets should 
never be shaved. 

Riveting Procedure 
The riveting procedure consists of transferring and preparing 
the hole, drilling, and driving the rivets. 

Hole Transfer 

Accomplish transfer of holes from a drilled part to another 
part by placing the second part over first and using established 
holes as a guide. Using an alternate method, scribe hole 
location through from drilled part onto part to be drilled, 
spot with a center punch, and drill.

Hole Preparation

It is very important that the rivet hole be of the correct size 
and shape and free from burrs. If the hole is too small, the 
protective coating is scratched from the rivet when the rivet 
is driven through the hole. If the hole is too large, the rivet 
does not fill the hole completely. When it is bucked, the joint 
does not develop its full strength, and structural failure may 
occur at that spot.

If countersinking is required, consider the thickness of the 
metal and adopt the countersinking method recommended for 
that thickness. If dimpling is required, keep hammer blows 
or dimpling pressures to a minimum so that no undue work 
hardening occurs in the surrounding area.

Drilling 

Rivet holes in repair may be drilled with either a light 
power drill or a hand drill. The standard shank twist drill is 
most commonly used. Drill bit sizes for rivet holes should 
be the smallest size that permits easy insertion of the rivet, 
approximately 0.003-inch greater than the largest tolerance 
of the shank diameter. The recommended clearance drill bits 
for the common rivet diameters are shown in Figure 4-90. 

Hole sizes for other fasteners are normally found on work 
documents, prints, or in manuals.

Before drilling, center punch all rivet locations. The center 
punch mark should be large enough to prevent the drill from 
slipping out of position, yet it must not dent the surface  
surrounding the center punch mark. Place a bucking bar 
behind the metal during punching to help prevent denting. 
To make a rivet hole the correct size, first drill a slightly 
undersized hole (pilot hole). Ream the pilot hole with a twist 
drill of the appropriate size to obtain the required dimension.

To drill, proceed as follows:

1. Ensure the drill bit is the correct size and shape. 

2. Place the drill in the center-punched mark. When using 
a power drill, rotate the bit a few turns before starting 
the motor.

3. While drilling, always hold the drill at a 90º angle to 
the work or the curvature of the material. 

4. Avoid excessive pressure, let the drill bit do the 
cutting, and never push the drill bit through stock. 

5. Remove all burrs with a metal countersink or a file. 

6. Clean away all drill chips.

When holes are drilled through sheet metal, small burrs are 
formed around the edge of the hole. This is especially true 
when using a hand drill because the drill speed is slow and 
there is a tendency to apply more pressure per drill revolution. 
Remove all burrs with a burr remover or larger size drill bit 
before riveting.

Driving the Rivet

Although riveting equipment can be either stationary or 
portable, portable riveting equipment is the most common 
type of riveting equipment used to drive solid shank rivets 
in airframe repair work. 

Before driving any rivets into the sheet metal parts, be sure 
all holes line up perfectly, all shavings and burrs have been 
removed, and the parts to be riveted are securely fastened 
with temporary fasteners. Depending on the job, the riveting 
process may require one or two people. In solo riveting, the 
riveter holds a bucking bar with one hand and operates a 
riveting gun with the other.

If the job requires two aircraft technicians, a shooter, or 
gunner, and a bucker work together as a team to install rivets. 
An important component of team riveting is an efficient 
signaling system that communicates the status of the riveting 
process. This signaling system usually consists of tapping 
the bucking bar against the work and is often called the tap

code. One tap may mean not fully seated, hit it again, while 
two taps may mean good rivet, and three taps may mean bad 
rivet, remove and drive another. Radio sets are also available 
for communication between the technicians.

Once the rivet is installed, there should be no evidence of 
rotation of rivets or looseness of riveted parts. After the 
trimming operation, examine for tightness. Apply a force 
of 10 pounds to the trimmed stem. A tight stem is one 
indication of an acceptable rivet installation. Any degree of 
looseness indicates an oversize hole and requires replacement 
of the rivet with an oversize shank diameter rivet. A rivet 
installation is assumed satisfactory when the rivet head is 
seated snugly against the item to be retained (0.005-inch 
feeler gauge should not go under rivet head for more than 
one-half the circumference) and the stem is proved tight.

Countersunk Rivets
An improperly made countersink reduces the strength of a 
flush-riveted joint and may even cause failure of the sheet or 
the rivet head. The two methods of countersinking commonly 
used for flush riveting in aircraft construction and repair are:

• Machine or drill countersinking.

• Dimpling or press countersinking.

The proper method for any particular application depends on 
the thickness of the parts to be riveted, the height and angle 
of the countersunk head, the tools available, and accessibility.

Countersinking

When using countersunk rivets, it is necessary to make a 
conical recess in the skin for the head. The type of countersink 
required depends upon the relation of the thickness of the 
sheets to the depth of the rivet head. Use the proper degree 
and diameter countersink and cut only deep enough for the 
rivet head and metal to form a flush surface.
 
Countersinking is an important factor in the design of fastener 
patterns, as the removal of material in the countersinking 
process necessitates an increase in the number of fasteners to 
assure the required load-transfer strength. If countersinking 
is done on metal below a certain thickness, a knife edge with 
less than the minimum bearing surface or actual enlarging of 
the hole may result. The edge distance required when using 
countersunk fasteners is greater than when universal head 
fasteners are used.

The general rule for countersinking and flush fastener 
installation procedures has been reevaluated in recent years 
because countersunk holes have been responsible for fatigue 
cracks in aircraft pressurized skin. In the past, the general rule 
for countersinking held that the fastener head must be contained 

within the outer sheet. A combination of countersinks too deep 
(creating a knife edge), number of pressurization cycles, 
fatigue, deterioration of bonding materials, and working 
fasteners caused a high stress concentration that resulted in 
skin cracks and fastener failures. In primary structure and 
pressurized skin repairs, some manufacturers are currently 
recommending the countersink depth be no more than 2⁄3 the 
outer sheet thickness or down to 0.020-inch minimum fastener 
shank depth, whichever is greater. Dimple the skin if it is too 
thin for machine countersinking. [Figure 4-91]

Keep the rivet high before driving to ensure the force of 
riveting is applied to the rivet and not to the skin. If the rivet 
is driven while it is flush or too deep, the surrounding skin 
is work hardened.

Countersinking Tools

While there are many types of countersink tools, the most 
commonly used has an included angle of 100°. Sometimes 
types of 82° or 120° are used to form countersunk wells. 
[Figure 4-84] A six-fluted countersink works best in 
aluminum. There are also four- and three-fluted countersinks, 
but those are harder to control from a chatter standpoint. A 
single-flute type, such as those manufactured by the Weldon 
Tool Company®, works best for corrosion-resistant steel. 
[Figure 4-92]


4-42

Figure 4-93. Hand squeezers.

Figure 4-92. Single-flute countersink.

The microstop countersink is the preferred countersinking 
tool. [Figure 4-85] It has an adjustable-sleeve cage that 
functions as a limit stop and holds the revolving countersink 
in a vertical position. Its threaded and replaceable cutters may 
have either a removable or an integral pilot that keeps the 
cutter centered in the hole. The pilot should be approximately 
0.002-inch smaller than the hole size. It is recommended 
to test adjustments on a piece of scrap material before 
countersinking repair or replacement parts.

Freehand countersinking is needed where a microstop 
countersink cannot fit. This method should be practiced on 
scrap material to develop the required skill. Holding the 
drill motor steady and perpendicular is as critical during this 
operation as when drilling.

Chattering is the most common problem encountered when 
countersinking. Some precautions that may eliminate or 
minimize chatter include:

• Use sharp tooling.

• Use a slow speed and steady firm pressure.

• Use a piloted countersink with a pilot approximately 
0.002-inch smaller than the hole.

• Use back-up material to hold the pilot steady when 
countersinking thin sheet material.

• Use a cutter with a different number of flutes.

• Pilot drill an undersized hole, countersink, and then 
enlarge the hole to final size.

Dimpling

Dimpling is the process of making an indentation or a 
dimple around a rivet hole to make the top of the head of 
a countersunk rivet flush with the surface of the metal. 
Dimpling is done with a male and female die, or forms, often 
called punch and die set. The male die has a guide the size of 
the rivet hole and is beveled to correspond to the degree of 
countersink of the rivet head. The female die has a hole into 
which the male guide fits and is beveled to a corresponding 
degree of countersink.

When dimpling, rest the female die on a solid surface. Then, 
place the material to be dimpled on the female die. Insert the 
male die in the hole to be dimpled and, with a hammer, strike 
the male die until the dimple is formed. Two or three solid 
hammer blows should be sufficient. A separate set of dies is 
necessary for each size of rivet and shape of rivet head. An 
alternate method is to use a countersunk head rivet instead 
of the regular male punch die, and a draw set instead of the 
female die, and hammer the rivet until the dimple is formed. 

Dimpling dies for light work can be used in portable 
pneumatic or hand squeezers. [Figure 4-93] If the dies are 
used with a squeezer, they must be adjusted accurately to the 
thickness of the sheet being dimpled. A table riveter is also 
used for dimpling thin skin material and installing rivets. 
[Figure 4-94]

Coin Dimpling

The coin dimpling, or coin pressing, method uses a 
countersink rivet as the male dimpling die. Place the female 
die in the usual position and back it with a bucking bar. Place 
the rivet of the required type into the hole and strike the rivet 
with a pneumatic riveting hammer. Coin dimpling should 
be used only when the regular male die is broken or not 
available. Coin pressing has the distinct disadvantage of the

rivet hole needing to be drilled to correct rivet size before the 
dimpling operation is accomplished. Since the metal stretches 
during the dimpling operation, the hole becomes enlarged and 
the rivet must be swelled slightly before driving to produce 
a close fit. Because the rivet head causes slight distortions in 
the recess, and these are characteristic only to that particular 
rivet head, it is wise to drive the same rivet that was used as 
the male die during the dimpling process. Do not substitute 
another rivet, either of the same size or a size larger.

Radius Dimpling

Radius dimpling uses special die sets that have a radius 
and are often used with stationary or portable squeezers. 
Dimpling removes no metal and, due to the nestling effect, 
gives a stronger joint than the non-flush type. A dimpled 
joint reduces the shear loading on the rivet and places more 
load on the riveted sheets.

NOTE: Dimpling is also done for flush bolts and other  
flush fasteners.

Dimpling is required for sheets that are thinner than the 
minimum specified thickness for countersinking. However, 
dimpling is not limited to thin materials. Heavier parts may 
be dimpled without cracking by specialized hot dimpling 
equipment. The temper of the material, rivet size, and 
available equipment are all factors to be considered in 
dimpling. [Figure 4-95]

Hot Dimpling

Hot dimpling is the process that uses heated dimpling dies to 
ensure the metal flows better during the dimpling process. Hot 
dimpling is often performed with large stationary equipment 
available in a sheet metal shop. The metal being used is 
an important factor because each metal presents different 
dimpling problems. For example, 2024-T3 aluminum alloy 
can be satisfactorily dimpled either hot or cold, but may crack 

in the vicinity of the dimple after cold dimpling because of 
hard spots in the metal. Hot dimpling prevents such cracking. 

7075-T6 aluminum alloys are always hot dimpled. 
Magnesium alloys also must be hot dimpled because, like 
7075-T6, they have low formability qualities. Titanium is 
another metal that must be hot dimpled because it is tough 
and resists forming. The same temperature and dwell time 
used to hot dimple 7075-T6 is used for titanium. 

100° Combination Predimple and Countersink Method

Metals of different thicknesses are sometimes joined 
by a combination of dimpling and countersinking. 
[Figure 4-96] A countersink well made to receive a dimple 
is called a subcountersink. These are most often seen where

thin gap seals, wear strips, and repairs for worn countersinks.

Dimpling Inspection

To determine the quality of a dimple, it is necessary to make 
a close visual inspection. Several features must be checked. 
The rivet head should fit flush and there should be a sharp 
break from the surface into the dimple. The sharpness of the 
break is affected by dimpling pressure and metal thickness. 
Selected dimples should be checked by inserting a fastener to 
make sure that the flushness requirements are met. Cracked 
dimples are caused by poor dies, rough holes, or improper 
heating. Two types of cracks may form during dimpling:

• Radial cracks—start at the edge and spread outward as 
the metal within the dimple stretches. They are most 
common in 2024-T3. A rough hole or a dimple that 
is too deep causes such cracks. A small tolerance is 
usually allowed for radial cracks.

• Circumferential cracks—downward bending into the 
draw die causes tension stresses in the upper portion 
of the metal. Under some conditions, a crack may 
be created that runs around the edge of the dimple. 
Such cracks do not always show since they may be 

underneath the cladding. When found, they are cause 
for rejection. These cracks are most common in hot-
dimpled 7075 T6 aluminum alloy material. The usual 
cause is insufficient dimpling heat.

Evaluating the Rivet
To obtain high structural efficiency in the manufacture and 
repair of aircraft, an inspection must be made of all rivets 
before the part is put in service. This inspection consists of 
examining both the shop and manufactured heads and the 
surrounding skin and structural parts for deformities. A scale 
or rivet gauge can be used to check the condition of the upset 
rivet head to see that it conforms to the proper requirements. 
Deformities in the manufactured head can be detected by the 
trained eye alone. [Figure 4-97]

Some common causes of unsatisfactory riveting are improper 
bucking, rivet set slipping off or being held at the wrong 
angle, and rivet holes or rivets of the wrong size. Additional 
causes for unsatisfactory riveting are countersunk rivets not 
flush with the well, work not properly fastened together 
during riveting, the presence of burrs, rivets too hard, too 
much or too little driving, and rivets out of line.


4-45

Occasionally, during an aircraft structural repair, it is wise 
to examine adjacent parts to determine the true condition 
of neighboring rivets. In doing so, it may be necessary to 
remove the paint. The presence of chipped or cracked paint 
around the heads may indicate shifted or loose rivets. Look 
for tipped or loose rivet heads. If the heads are tipped or if 
rivets are loose, they show up in groups of several consecutive 
rivets and probably tipped in the same direction. If heads that 
appear to be tipped are not in groups and are not tipped in 
the same direction, tipping may have occurred during some 
previous installation.

Inspect rivets known to have been critically loaded, but 
that show no visible distortion, by drilling off the head and 
carefully punching out the shank. If, upon examination, the 
shank appears joggled and the holes in the sheet misaligned, 
the rivet has failed in shear. In that case, try to determine 
what is causing the shearing stress and take the necessary 
corrective action. Flush rivets that show head slippage within 
the countersink or dimple, indicating either sheet bearing 
failure or rivet shear failure, must be removed for inspection 
and replacement.

Joggles in removed rivet shanks indicate partial shear failure. 
Replace these rivets with the next larger size. Also, if the rivet 
holes show elongation, replace the rivets with the next larger 
size. Sheet failures such as tear-outs, cracks between rivets, 
and the like usually indicate damaged rivets. The complete 
repair of the joint may require replacement of the rivets with 
the next larger size.

The general practice of replacing a rivet with the next larger 
size (1⁄32-inch greater diameter) is necessary to obtain the 
proper joint strength of rivet and sheet when the original rivet 
hole is enlarged. If the rivet in an elongated hole is replaced 
by a rivet of the same size, its ability to carry its share of the 
shear load is impaired and joint weakness results.

Removal of Rivets
When a rivet has to be replaced, remove it carefully to retain 
the rivet hole’s original size and shape. If removed correctly, 
the rivet does not need to be replaced with one of the next 
larger size. Also, if the rivet is not removed properly, the 
strength of the joint may be weakened and the replacement 
of rivets made more difficult.

When removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It 
is more symmetrical about the shank than the shop head, and 
there is less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material 
around it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill, or 
a combination of both. 

The procedure for universal or protruding head rivet removal 
is as  follows:

1. File a flat area on the head of the rivet and center punch 
the flat surface for drilling.

 NOTE: On thin metal, back up the rivet on the upset 
head when center punching to avoid depressing  
the metal.

2. Use a drill bit one size smaller than the rivet shank to 
drill out the rivet head. 

 NOTE: When using a power drill, set the drill on the 
rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand 
before turning on the power. This procedure helps the 
drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the chance 
of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. 

3. Drill the rivet to the depth of its head, while holding 
the drill at a 90° angle. Do not drill too deeply, as the 
rivet shank will then turn with the drill and tear the 
surrounding metal.

 NOTE: The rivet head often breaks away and climbs 
the drill, which is a signal to withdraw the drill.

4. If the rivet head does not come loose of its own accord, 
insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to 
either side until the head comes off.

5. Drive the remaining rivet shank out with a drift punch 
slightly smaller than the shank diameter. 

On thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet 
with a bucking bar while driving out the shank. If the shank is 
unusually tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet 
about two-thirds through the thickness of the material and then 
drive the rest of it out with a drift punch. Figure 4-98 shows 
the preferred procedure for removing universal rivets.

The procedure for the removal of countersunk rivets is the 
same as described above except no filing is necessary. Be 
careful to avoid elongation of the dimpled or the countersunk 
holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately one-
half the thickness of the top sheet. The dimple in 2117–T 
rivets usually eliminates the necessity of filing and center 
punching the rivet head.

To remove a countersunk or flush head rivet, you must:

1. Select a drill about 0.003-inch smaller than the rivet 
shank diameter. 

2. Drill into the exact center of the rivet head to the 
approximate depth of the head.

Rivet Removal

Remove rivets by drilling off the head and punching out the shank as illustrated.
1. File a flat area on the manufactured head of non-flush rivets.
2. Place a block of wood or a bucking bar under both flush and nonflush rivets when center punching the manufactured head.
3. Use a drill that is 1/32 (0.0312) inch smaller than the rivet shank to drill through the head of the rivet. Ensure the drilling
 operation does not damage the skin or cut the sides of the rivet hole.
4. Insert a drift punch into the hole drilled in the rivet and tilt the punch to break off the rivet head.
5. Using a drift punch and hammer, drive out the rivet shank. Support the opposite side of the structure to prevent 
 structural damage.

Figure 4-98. Rivet removal. 

3. Remove the head by breaking it off. Use a punch as 
a lever.

4. Punch out the shank. Use a suitable backup, preferably 
wood (or equivalent), or a dedicated backup block. If 
the shank does not come out easily, use a small drill 
and drill through the shank. Be careful not to elongate 
the hole.

Replacing Rivets
Replace rivets with those of the same size and strength 
whenever possible. If the rivet hole becomes enlarged, 
deformed, or otherwise damaged, drill or ream the hole for 
the next larger size rivet. Do not replace a rivet with a type 
having lower strength properties, unless the lower strength 

is adequately compensated by an increase in size or a greater 
number of rivets. It is acceptable to replace 2017 rivets of 
3⁄16-inch diameter or less, and 2024 rivets of 5⁄32-inch diameter 
or less with 2117 rivets for general repairs, provided the 
replacement rivets are 1⁄32-inch greater in diameter than the 
rivets they replace.

National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
(NACA) Method of Double Flush Riveting
A rivet installation technique known as the National Advisory 
Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) method has primary 
applications in fuel tank areas. [Figure 4-99] To make  
a NACA rivet installation, the shank is upset into a 82° 
countersink. In driving, the gun may be used on either the

head or shank side. The upsetting is started with light blows, 
then the force increased and the gun or bar moved on the 
shank end so as to form a head inside the countersink well. 
If desired, the upset head may be shaved flush after driving. 
If utilizing this method, it is important to reference the 
manufacturer’s instructions for repair or replacement.

Special Purpose Fasteners
Special purpose fasteners are designed for applications in 
which fastener strength, ease of installation, or temperature 
properties of the fastener require consideration. Solid shank 
rivets have been the preferred construction method for metal 
aircraft for many years because they fill up the hole, which 
results in good load transfer, but they are not always ideal. 
For example, the attachment of many nonstructural parts 
(aircraft interior furnishings, flooring, deicing boots, etc.) 
do not need the full strength of solid shank rivets.

To install solid shank rivets, the aircraft technician must 
have access to both sides of a riveted structure or structural 
part. There are many places on an aircraft where this access 
is impossible or where limited space does not permit the use
of a bucking bar. In these instances, it is not possible to use 
solid shank rivets, and special fasteners have been designed 
that can be bucked from the front. [Figure 4-100]  There are 
also areas of high loads, high fatigue, and bending on aircraft. 
Although the shear loads of riveted joints are very good, the 
tension, or clamp-up, loads are less than ideal. 

Special purpose fasteners are sometimes lighter than solid 
shank rivets, yet strong enough for their intended use. These 
fasteners are manufactured by several corporations and 
have unique characteristics that require special installation 
tools, special installation procedures, and special removal 
procedures. Because these fasteners are often inserted in 
locations where one head, usually the shop head, cannot be 
seen, they are called blind rivets or blind fasteners.

Typically, the locking characteristics of a blind rivet are not 
as good as a driven rivet. Therefore, blind rivets are usually 
not used when driven rivets can be installed. Blind rivets 
shall not be used: 

1. In fluid-tight areas.

2. On aircraft in air intake areas where rivet parts may 
be ingested by the engine.

3. On aircraft control surfaces, hinges, hinge brackets, 
flight control actuating systems, wing attachment 
fittings, landing gear fittings, on floats or amphibian 
hulls below the water level, or other heavily stressed 
locations on the aircraft.

NOTE: For metal repairs to the airframe, the use of blind 
rivets must be specifically authorized by the airframe 
manufacturer or approved by a representative of the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA).

Blind Rivets
The first blind fasteners were introduced in 1940 by the 
Cherry Rivet Company (now Cherry® Aerospace), and the 
aviation industry quickly adopted them. The past decades 
have seen a proliferation of blind fastening systems based on 
the original concept, which consists of a tubular rivet with 
a fixed head and a hollow sleeve. Inserted within the rivet’s 
core is a stem that is enlarged or serrated on its exposed end 
when activated by a pulling-type rivet gun. The lower end 
of the stem extends beyond the inner sheet of metal. This 
portion contains a tapered joining portion and a blind head 
that has a larger diameter than the stem or the sleeve of the 
tubular rivet. 

When the pulling force of the rivet gun forces the blind head 
upward into the sleeve, its stem upsets or expands the lower 
end of the sleeve into a tail. This presses the inner sheet 
upward and closes any space that might have existed between 
it and the outer sheet. Since the exposed head of the rivet is 
held tightly against the outer sheet by the rivet gun, the sheets 
of metal are clamped, or clinched, together.

Figure 4-101. Friction-lock blind rivet.

NOTE: Fastener manufacturers use different terminology to 
describe the parts of the blind rivet. The terms “mandrel,” 
“spindle,” and “stem” are often used interchangeably. For 
clarity, the word “stem” is used in this handbook and refers 
to the piece that is inserted into the hollow sleeve.

Friction-Locked Blind Rivets

Standard self-plugging blind rivets consist of a hollow sleeve 
and a stem with increased diameter in the plug section. 
The blind head is formed as the stem is pulled into the 
sleeve. Friction-locked blind rivets have a multiple-piece 
construction and rely on friction to lock the stem to the 
sleeve. As the stem is drawn up into the rivet shank, the 
stem portion upsets the shank on the blind side, forming a 
plug in the hollow center of the rivet. The excess portion of 
the stem breaks off at a groove due to the continued pulling 
action of the rivet gun. Metals used for these rivets are 2117-
T4 and 5056-F aluminum alloy. Monel® is used for special 
applications.

Many friction-locked blind rivet center stems fall out due to 
vibration, which greatly reduces its shear strength. To combat 
that problem, most friction-lock blind rivets are replaced by 
the mechanical-lock, or stem-lock, type of blind fasteners. 
However, some types, such as the Cherry SPR® 3⁄32-inch 
Self-Plugging Rivet, are ideal for securing nutplates located 
in inaccessible and hard-to-reach areas where bucking or 
squeezing of solid rivets is unacceptable. [Figure 4-102]

Friction-lock blind rivets are less expensive than mechanical-
lock blind rivets and are sometimes used for nonstructural 
applications. Inspection of friction-lock blind rivets is 

visual. A more detailed discussion on how to inspect riveted 
joints can be found in the section, General Repair Practices. 
Removal of friction-lock blind rivets consists of punching out 
the friction-lock stem and then treating it like any other rivet.

Mechanical-Lock Blind Rivets

The self-plugging, mechanical-lock blind rivet was developed 
to prevent the problem of losing the center stem due to 
vibration. This rivet has a device on the puller or rivet head 
that locks the center stem into place when installed. Bulbed, 
self-plugging, mechanically-locked blind rivets form a large, 
blind head that provides higher strength in thin sheets when 
installed. They may be used in applications where the blind 
head is formed against a dimpled sheet. 

Manufacturers such as Cherry® Aerospace (CherryMAX®, 
CherryLOCK®, Cherry SST®) and Alcoa Fastening Systems 
(Huck-Clinch®, HuckMax®, Unimatic®) make many 
variations of this of blind rivet. While similar in design, the 
tooling for these rivets is often not interchangeable. 

The CherryMAX® Bulbed blind rivet is one of the earlier 
types of mechanical-lock blind rivets developed. Their main 
advantage is the ability to replace a solid shank rivet size 
for size. The CherryMAX® Bulbed blind rivet consists of 
four parts:

1. A fully serrated stem with break notch, shear ring, and 
integral grip adjustment cone.

2. A driving anvil to ensure a visible mechanical lock 
with each fastener installation.

3. A separate, visible, and inspectable locking collar that 
mechanically locks the stem to the rivet sleeve.

4. A rivet sleeve with recess in the head to receive the 
locking collar. 

It is called a bulbed fastener due to its large blind side 
bearing surface, developed during the installation process. 
These rivets are used in thin sheet applications and for use 
in materials that may be damaged by other types of blind 
rivets. This rivet features a safe-lock locking collar for more 
reliable joint integrity. The rough end of the retained stem 
in the center on the manufactured head must never be filed 
smooth because it weakens the strength of the lockring, and 
the center stem could fall out.

CherryMAX® bulbed rivets are available in three head styles: 
universal, 100° countersunk, and 100° reduced shear head 
styles. Their lengths are measured in increments of 1⁄16 inch. 
It is important to select a rivet with a length related to the 
grip length of the metal being joined. This blind rivet can 
be installed using either the Cherry® G750A or the newly 
released Cherry® G800 hand riveters, or either the pneumatic-


4-49

1 2 3 4

The CherryMAX® rivet is 
inserted into the prepared 
hole. The pulling head 
(installation tool) is slipped 
over the rivet’s stem. 
Applying a firm, steady 
pressure, which seats the 
rivet head, the installation 
tool is then actuated.

The pulling head holds the 
rivet sleeve in place as it 
begins to pull the rivet stem 
into the rivet sleeve. This 
pulling action causes the 
stem shear ring to upset the 
rivet sleeve and form the 
bulbed blind head.

The continued pulling action of 
the installation tool causes the 
stem shear ring to shear from 
the main body of the stem as 
the stem continues to move 
through the rivet sleeve. This 
action allows the fastener to 
accommodate a minimum of 
1/16"" variation in structure 
thickness. The locking collar 
then contacts the driving anvil. 
As the stem continues to be 
pulled by the action of the 
installation tool, the Safe-Lock 
locking collar deforms into the 
rivet sleeve head recess.

The safe-lock locking collar 
fills the rivet sleeve head 
recess, locking the stem and 
rivet sleeve securely together. 
Continued pulling by the 
installation tool causes the 
stem to fracture at the break 
notch, providing a flush, 
burr-free, inspectable 
installation.

The CherryMAX® mechanical-lock blind rivet is popular 
with general aviation repair shops because it features the 
one tool concept to install three standard rivet diameters and 
their oversize counterparts. [Figure 4-103] CherryMAX® 

rivets are available in four nominal diameters: 1⁄8, 5⁄32, 3⁄16, and 
1⁄4-inch and three oversized diameters and four head styles: 
universal, 100° flush head, 120° flush head, and NAS1097 
flush head. This rivet consists of a blind header, hollow rivet 
shell, locking (foil) collar, driving anvil, and pulling stem 
complete with wrapped locking collar. The rivet sleeve and 


4-50

the driving washer blind bulbed header takes up the extended 
shank and forms the bucktail.

The stem and rivet sleeve work as an assembly to provide 
radial expansion and a large bearing footprint on the blind 
side of the fastened surface. The lock collar ensures that the 
stem and sleeve remain assembled during joint loading and 
unloading. Rivet sleeves are made from 5056 aluminum, 
Monel® and INCO 600. The stems are made from alloy 
steel, CRES, and INCO® X-750. CherryMAX® rivets have 
an ultimate shear strength ranging from 50 KSI to 75 KSI.
 
Removal of Mechanically-Locked Blind Rivets

Mechanically-locked blind rivets are a challenge to remove 
because they are made from strong, hard metals. Lack of 
access poses yet another problem for the aviation technician. 
Designed for and used in difficult to reach locations means 
there is often no access to the blind side of the rivet or any way 
to provide support for the sheet metal surrounding the rivet’s 
location when the aviation technician attempts removal.

The stem is mechanically locked by a small lock ring that 
needs to be removed first. Use a small center drill to provide 
a guide for a larger drill on top of the rivet stem and drill 
away the upper portion of the stem to destroy the lock. Try 
to remove the lock ring or use a prick punch or center punch 
to drive the stem down a little and remove the lock ring. 
After the lock ring is removed, the stem can be driven out 
with a drive punch. After the stem is removed, the rivet can 
be drilled out in the same way as a solid rivet. If possible, 
support the back side of the rivet with a backup block to 
prevent damage to the aircraft skin. 

Pin Fastening Systems (High-Shear Fasteners) 
A pin fastening system, or high-shear pin rivet, is a two-piece 
fastener that consists of a threaded pin and a collar. The metal 
collar is swaged onto the grooved end, effecting a firm tight 
fit. They are essentially threadless bolts.

High-shear rivets are installed with standard bucking bars 
and pneumatic riveting hammers. They require the use 
of a special gun set that incorporates collar swaging and 
trimming and a discharge port through which excess collar 
material is discharged. A separate size set is required for each  
shank diameter.

Installation of High-Shear Fasteners

Prepare holes for pin rivets with the same care as for other 
close tolerance rivets or bolts. At times, it may be necessary 
to spot-face the area under the head of the pin to ensure the 
head of the rivet fits tightly against the material. The spot-
faced area should be 1⁄16-inch larger in diameter than the 
head diameter. Pin rivets may be driven from either end. 

Procedures for driving a pin rivet from the collar end are:

1. Insert the rivet in the hole.

2. Place a bucking bar against the rivet head.

3. Slip the collar over the protruding rivet end.

4. Place previously selected rivet set and gun over the 
collar. Align the gun until it is perpendicular to the 
material.

5. Depress the trigger on the gun, applying pressure to 
the rivet collar. This action causes the rivet collar to 
swage into the groove on the rivet end.

6. Continue the driving action until the collar is properly 
formed and excess collar material is trimmed off.

Procedures for driving a pin rivet from the head end are:

1. Insert the rivet in the hole.

2. Slip the collar over the protruding end of rivet.

3. Insert the correct size gun rivet set in a bucking bar 
and place the set against the collar of the rivet.

4. Apply pressure against the rivet head with a flush rivet 
set and pneumatic riveting hammer.

5. Continue applying pressure until the collar is formed 
in the groove and excess collar material is trimmed 
off.

Inspection

Pin rivets should be inspected on both sides of the material. 
The head of the rivet should not be marred and should fit 
tightly against the material.

Removal of Pin Rivets

The conventional method of removing rivets by drilling off 
the head may be utilized on either end of the pin rivet. Center 
punching is recommended prior to applying drilling pressure. 
In some cases, alternate methods may be needed:

• Grind a chisel edge on a small pin punch to a blade 
width of 1⁄8-inch. Place this tool at right angles to the 
collar and drive with a hammer to split the collar down 
one side. Repeat the operation on the opposite side. 
Then, with the chisel blade, pry the collar from the 
rivet. Tap the rivet out of the hole.

• Use a special hollow punch having one or more blades 
placed to split the collar. Pry the collar from the groove 
and tap out the rivet. 

• Sharpen the cutting blades of a pair of nippers. Cut 
the collar in two pieces or use nippers at right angles 
to the rivet and cut through the small neck. 


4-51

Figure 4-104. Hi-Lok®.

• A hollow-mill collar cutter can be used in a power hand 
drill to cut away enough collar material to permit the 
rivet to be tapped out of the work.

The high-shear pin rivet family includes fasteners, such as 
the Hi-Lok®, Hi-Tigue®, and Hi-Lite® made by Hi-Shear 
Corporation and the CherryBUCK® 95 KSI One-Piece Shear 
Pin and Cherry E-Z Buck® Shear Pin made by Cherry® 
Aerospace.

Hi-Lok® Fastening System

The threaded end of the Hi-Lok® two-piece fastener contains 
a hexagonal shaped recess. [Figure 4-104] The hex tip of an 
Allen wrench engages the recess to prevent rotation of the 
pin while the collar is being installed. The pin is designed 
in two basic head styles. For shear applications, the pin is 
made in countersunk style and in a compact protruding head 
style. For tension applications, the MS24694 countersunk and 
regular protruding head styles are available.

The self-locking, threaded Hi-Lok® collar has an internal 
counterbore at the base to accommodate variations in 
material thickness. At the opposite end of the collar is a 
wrenching device that is torqued by the driving tool until it 
shears off during installation, leaving the lower portion of 
the collar seated with the proper torque without additional 
torque inspection. This shear-off point occurs when a 
predetermined preload or clamp-up is attained in the fastener 
during installation.

The advantages of Hi-Lok® two-piece fastener include its 
lightweight, high fatigue resistance, high strength, and its 
inability to be overtorqued. The pins, made from alloy steel, 
corrosion-resistant steel, or titanium alloy, come in many 
standard and oversized shank diameters. The collars are made 
of aluminum alloy, corrosion-resistant steel, or alloy steel. 
The collars have wrenching flats, fracture point, threads, and 
a recess. The wrenching flats are used to install the collar. 
The fracture point has been designed to allow the wrenching 

flats to shear when the proper torque has been reached. The 
threads match the threads of the pins and have been formed 
into an ellipse that is distorted to provide the locking action. 
The recess serves as a built-in washer. This area contains a 
portion of the shank and the transition area of the fastener.

The hole shall be prepared so that the maximum interference 
fit does not exceed 0.002-inch. This avoids build up of 
excessive internal stresses in the work adjacent to the hole. 
The Hi-Lok® pin has a slight radius under its head to increase 
fatigue life. After drilling, deburr the edge of the hole to allow 
the head to seat fully in the hole. The Hi-Lok® is installed in 
interference fit holes for aluminum structure and a clearance 
fit for steel, titanium, and composite materials.

Hi-Tigue® Fastening System

The Hi-Tigue® fastener offers all of the benefits of the Hi-
Lok® fastening system along with a unique bead design that 
enhances the fatigue performance of the structure making 
it ideal for situations that require a controlled interference 
fit. The Hi-Tigue® fastener assembly consists of a pin and 
collar. These pin rivets have a radius at the transition area. 
During installation in an interference fit hole, the radius area 
will “cold work” the hole. These fastening systems can be 
easily confused, and visual reference should not be used for 
identification. Use part numbers to identify these fasteners.

Hi-Lite® Fastening System

The Hi-Lite® fastener is similar in design and principle to 
the Hi-Lok® fastener, but the Hi-Lite® fastener has a shorter 
transition area between the shank and the first load-bearing 
thread. Hi-Lite® has approximately one less thread. All Hi-
Lite® fasteners are made of titanium.

These differences reduce the weight of the Hi-Lite® fastener 
without lessening the shear strength, but the Hi-Lite® 
clamping forces are less than that of a Hi-Lok® fastener. 
The Hi-Lite® collars are also different and thus are not 
interchangeable with Hi-Lok® collars. Hi-Lite® fasteners can 
be replaced with Hi-Lok® fasteners for most applications, but 
Hi-Loks® cannot be replaced with Hi-Lites®. 
 
CherryBUCK® 95 KSI One-Piece Shear Pin 

The CherryBUCK® is a bimetallic, one-piece fastener that 
combines a 95 KSI shear strength shank with a ductile, 
titanium-columbium tail. Theses fasteners are functionally 
interchangeable with comparable 6AI-4V titanium alloy 
two-piece shear fasteners, but with a number of advantages. 
Their one piece design means no foreign object damage 
(FOD), it has a 600 °F allowable temperature, and a very 
low backside profile.

Lockbolt Fastening Systems 
Also pioneered in the 1940s, the lockbolt is a two-piece 
fastener that combines the features of a high-strength bolt 
and a rivet with advantages over each. [Figure 4-105] In 
general, a lockbolt is a nonexpanding fastener that has either 
a collar swaged into annular locking grooves on the pin shank 
or a type of threaded collar to lock it in place. Available 
with either countersunk or protruding heads, lockbolts are 
permanent type fasteners assemblies and consist of a pin 
and a collar. 

A lockbolt is similar to an ordinary rivet in that the locking 
collar, or nut, is weak in tension and it is difficult to remove 
once installed. Some of the lockbolts are similar to blind 
rivets and can be completely installed from one side. Others 
are fed into the workpiece with the manufactured head on the 
far side. The installation is completed on the near side with 
a gun similar to blind rivet gun. The lockbolt is easier and 
more quickly installed than the conventional rivet or bolt and 
eliminates the use of lockwashers, cotter pins, and special 
nuts. The lockbolt is generally used in wing splice fittings, 
landing gear fittings, fuel cell fittings, longerons, beams, skin 
splice plates, and other major structural attachment.

Often called huckbolts, lockbolts are manufactured by 
companies such as Cherry® Aerospace (Cherry® Lockbolt), 
Alcoa Fastening Systems (Hucktite® Lockbolt System), 
and SPS Technologies. Used primarily for heavily stressed 
structures that require higher shear and clamp-up values than 
can be obtained with rivets, the lockbolt and Hi-lok® are often 
used for similar applications. Lockbolts are made in various 
head styles, alloys, and finishes. 

The lockbolt requires a pneumatic hammer or pull gun 
for installation. Lockbolts have their own grip gauge 
and an installation tool is required for their installation. 
[Figure 4-106] When installed, the lockbolt is rigidly and 
permanently locked in place. Three types of lockbolts are 
commonly used: pull-type, stump-type, and blind-type.

The pull-type lockbolt is mainly used in aircraft and primary 
and secondary structure. It is installed very rapidly and has 
approximately one-half the weight of equivalent AN steel 
bolts and nuts. A special pneumatic pull gun is required for 
installation of this type lockbolt, which can be performed by 
one operator since buckling is not required.

The stump-type lockbolt, although not having the extended 
stem with pull grooves, is a companion fastener to the pull-
type lockbolt. It is used primarily where clearance does not 
permit effective installation of the pull-type lockbolt. It is 
driven with a standard pneumatic riveting hammer, with 
a hammer set attached for swaging the collar into the pin 
locking grooves, and a bucking bar.

The blind-type lockbolt comes as a complete unit or 
assembly and has exceptional strength and sheet pull-together 
characteristics. Blind-type lockbolts are used where only 
one side of the work is accessible and generally where it is 
difficult to drive a conventional rivet. This type lockbolt is 
installed in a manner similar to the pull-type lockbolt.

The pins of pull- and stump-type lockbolts are made of heat-
treated alloy steel or high-strength aluminum alloy. Companion 
collars are made of aluminum alloy or mild steel. The blind-
type lockbolt consists of a heat-treated alloy steel pin, blind 
sleeve, filler sleeve, mild steel collar, and carbon steel washer.

These fasteners are used in shear and tension applications. 
The pull-type is more common and can be installed by one 
person. The stump type requires a two-person installation. 
An assembly tool is used to swage the collar onto the serrated 
grooves in the pin and break the stem flush to the top of the 
collar.

The easiest way to differentiate between tension and shear 
pins is the number of locking grooves. Tension pins normally 
have four locking grooves and shear pins have two locking 
grooves. The installation tooling preloads the pin while 
swaging the collar. The surplus end of the pin, called the 
pintail, is then fractured.

Installation Procedure

Installation of lockbolts involves proper drilling. The hole 
preparation for a lockbolt is similar to hole preparation for a 


4-53

1 2 3 4

Continued force breaks the 
pin and ejects the tail. Anvil 
returns and disengages from 
the swaged collar.

The initial pull draws the work 
up tight and pulls that portion
of the shank under the head 
into the hole.

Further pull swages the collar 
into the locking grooves to 
form a permanent lock.

Placed the pin in the hole 
from the back side of the 
work and slip the collar on. 
The hold-off head must be 
toward the gun. This allows 
the gun to preload the pin 
before swaging. Then apply 
the gun; the chuck jaws 
engage the pull grooves of 
the projecting pintail. Hold 
the gun loosely and pull the 
trigger.

Hi-Lok®. An interference fit is typically used for aluminum 
and a clearance fit is used for steel, titanium, and composite 
materials. [Figure 4-107] 

Lockbolt Inspection

After installation, a lockbolt needs to be inspected to 
determine if installation is satisfactory. [Figure 4-108] 
Inspect the lockbolt as follows:

1. The head must be firmly seated.

2. The collar must be tight against the material and have 
the proper shape and size.

3. Pin protrusion must be within limits.

Lockbolt Removal

The best way to remove a lockbolt is to remove the collar and 
drive out the pin. The collar can be removed with a special 
collar cutter attached to a drill motor that mills off the collar 
without damaging the skin. If this is not possible, a collar 
splitter or small chisel can be used. Use a backup block on 
the opposite side to prevent elongation of the hole.

The Eddie-Bolt® 2 looks similar to the Hi-Lok®, but has five 
flutes, equally spaced along a portion of the pin thread area. 
A companion threaded collar deforms into the flutes at a 
predetermined torque and locks the collar in place. The collar 
can be unscrewed using special tooling. This fastening system 
can be used in either clearance or interference-fit holes.

Blind Bolts
Bolts are threaded fasteners that support loads through pre-
drilled holes. Hex, close-tolerance, and internal wrenching 
bolts are used in aircraft structural applications. Blind bolts 
have a higher strength than blind rivets and are used for 
joints that require high strength. Sometimes, these bolts can 
be direct replacements for the Hi-Lok® and lockbolt. Many 
of the new generation blind bolts are made from titanium

During the Maxibolt® installation sequence, the Cherry® 
shift washer collapses into itself, leaving a solid washer 
that is easily retrieved.

and rated at 90 KSI shear strength, which is twice as much 
as most blind rivets.

Determining the correct length of the fastener is critical to 
correct installation. The grip length of a bolt is the distance 
from the underhead bearing surface to the first thread. The 
grip is the total thickness of material joined by the bolt. 
Ideally, the grip length should be a few thousands of an inch 
less than the actual grip to avoid bottoming the nut. Special 
grip gauges are inserted in the hole to determine the length 
of the blind bolt to be used. Every blind bolt system has its 
own grip gauge and is not interchangeable with other blind 
bolt or rivet systems. 

Blind bolts are difficult to remove due to the hardness of 
the core bolt. A special removal kit is available from the 
manufacturer for removing each type of blind bolt. These 
kits make it easier to remove the blind bolt without damaging 
the hole and parent structure. Blind bolts are available in a 
pull-type and a drive-type.

Pull-Type Blind Bolt 

Several companies manufacture the pull-type of blind bolt 
fastening systems. They may differ in some design aspects, 
but in general they have a similar function. The pull-type uses 
the drive nut concept and is composed of a nut, sleeve, and 
a draw bolt. Frequently used blind bolt systems include but 
are not limited to the Cherry Maxibolt® Blind Bolt system 
and the HuckBolt® fasteners which includes the Ti-Matic® 
Blind Bolt and the Unimatic® Advanced Bolt (UAB) blind 
bolt systems.

Cherry Maxibolt® Blind Bolt System

The Cherry Maxibolt® blind bolt, available in alloy steel 
and A-286 CRES materials, comes in four different nominal 
and oversized head styles. [Figure 4-109] One tool and 
pulling head installs all three diameters. The blind bolts 
create a larger blind side footprint and they provide excellent 
performance in thin sheet and nonmetallic applications. The 

flush breaking stem eliminates shaving while the extended 
grip range accommodates different application thicknesses. 
Cherry Maxibolts® are primarily used in structures where 
higher loads are required. The steel version is 112 KSI shear. 
The A286 version is 95 KSI shear. The Cherry® G83, G84, 
or G704 installation tools are required for installation. 

Huck Blind Bolt System

The Huck Blind Bolt is a high strength vibration-resistant 
fastener. [Figure 4-110] These bolts have been used 
successfully in many critical areas, such as engine inlets and 
leading edge applications. All fasteners are installed with a 
combination of available hand, pneumatic, pneudraulic, or 
hydraulic pull-type tools (no threads) for ease of installation. 

Huck Blind Bolts can be installed on blind side angle 
surfaces up to 5° without loss of performance. The stem is 
mechanically locked to provide vibration-resistant FOD-free 
installations. The locking collar is forced into a conical pocket 
between stem and sleeve, creating high tensile capability. The 
lock collar fills the sleeve lock pocket to prevent leakage or 
corrosion pockets (crevice corrosion). 

Flush head blind bolts are designed to install with a flush 
stem break that often requires no trimming for aerodynamic 
surfaces. The Huck Blind Bolt is available in high-strength 
A286 CRES at 95KSI shear strength in 5⁄32-inch through 3⁄8-
inch diameters in 100° flush tension and protruding head. 
Also available are shear flush heads in 3⁄16-inch diameter. 
A286 CRES Huck Blind Bolts are also available in 1⁄64-inch 
oversize diameters for repair applications.

Drive Nut-Type of Blind Bolt

Jo-bolts, Visu-lok®, Composi-Lok®, OSI Bolt®, and Radial-
Lok® fasteners use the drive nut concept and are composed 
of a nut, sleeve, and a draw bolt. [Figure 4-111] These 
types of blind bolts are used for high strength applications 
in metals and composites when there is no access to the 
blind side. Available in steel and titanium alloys, they

are installed with special tooling. Both powered and hand 
tooling is available. During installation, the nut is held 
stationary while the core bolt is rotated by the installation 
tooling. The rotation of the core bolt draws the sleeve into 

the installed position and continues to retain the sleeve for 
the life of the fastener. The bolt has left hand threads and 
driving flats on the threaded end. A break-off relief allows 
the driving portion of the bolt to break off when the sleeve is 
properly seated. These types of bolts are available in many 
different head styles, including protruding head, 100° flush 
head, 130° flush head, and hex head.

Use the grip gauge available for the type of fastener and 
select the bolt grip after careful determination of the 
material thickness. The grip of the bolt is critical for correct 
installation. [Figure 4-112]

Installation procedure: 

1. Install the fastener into the hole, and place the 
installation tooling over the screw (stem) and nut.

2. Apply torque to the screw with the installation tool 
while keeping the drive nut stationary. The screw 
continues to advance through the nut body causing 
the sleeve to be drawn up over the tapered nose of 
the nut. When the sleeve forms tightly against the 
blind side of the structure, the screw fractures in the 
break groove. The stem of Jo-bolts, Visu-lok®, and 
Composi-Lok® II fasteners does not break off flush

used if a flush installation is required. The stem of the 
newer Composi-Lok3® and OSI Bolt® break off flush.

Tapered Shank Bolt

Tapered shank bolts, such as the Taper-Lok®, are lightweight, 
high strength shear or tension bolts. This bolt has a tapered 
shank designed to provide an interference fit upon installation. 
Tapered shank bolts can be identified by a round head (rather 
than a screwdriver slot or wrench flats) and a threaded shank. 
The Taper-Lok® is comprised of a tapered, conical-shank 
fastener, installed into a precision tapered hole. The use of 
tapered shank bolts is limited to special applications such as 
high stress areas of fuel tanks. It is important that a tapered 
bolt not be substituted for any other type of fastener in repairs. 
It is equally as important not to substitute any other type of 
fastener for a tapered bolt. 

Tapered shank bolts look similar to Hi-Lok® bolts after 
installation, but the tapered shank bolts do not have the hex 
recess at the threaded end of the bolt. Tapered shank bolts 
are installed in precision-reamed holes, with a controlled 
interference fit. The interference fit compresses the material 
around the hole that results in excellent load transfer, fatigue 
resistance, and sealing. The collar used with the tapered shank 
bolts has a captive washer, and no extra washers are required. 
New tapered shank bolt installation or rework of tapered shank 
bolt holes needs to be accomplished by trained personnel. 
Properly installed, these bolts become tightly wedged and do 
not turn while torque is applied to the nut. 

Sleeve Bolts

Sleeve bolts are used for similar purposes as tapered shank 
bolts, but are easier to install. Sleeve bolts, such as the two 
piece SLEEVbolt®, consist of a tapered shank bolt in an 
expandable sleeve. The sleeve is internally tapered and 
externally straight. The sleeve bolt is installed in a standard 
tolerance straight hole. During installation, the bolt is forced 
into the sleeve. This action expands the sleeve which fills 
the hole. It is easier to drill a straight tolerance hole than it 
is to drill the tapered hole required for a tapered shank bolt.

Rivet Nut
The rivet nut is a blind installed, internally-threaded rivet 
invented in 1936 by the Goodrich Rubber Company for the 
purpose of attaching a rubber aircraft wing deicer extrusion 
to the leading edge of the wing. The original rivet nut is the 
Rivnut® currently manufactured by Bollhoff Rivnut Inc. The 
Rivnut® became widely used in the military and aerospace 
markets because of its many design and assembly advantages. 

Rivet nuts are used for the installation of fairings, trim, and 
lightly loaded fittings that must be installed after an assembly 

is completed. [Figure 4-113] Often used for parts that are 
removed frequently, the rivet nut is available in two types: 
countersunk or flat head. Installed by crimping from one side, 
the rivet nut provides a threaded hole into which machine 
screws can be installed. Where a flush fit is required, the 
countersink style can be used. Rivet nuts made of alloy steel 
are used when increased tensile and shear strength is required.
 
Hole Preparation

Flat head rivet nuts require only the proper size of hole while 
flush installation can be made into either countersunk or 
dimpled skin. Metal thinner than the rivet nut head requires 
a dimple. The rivet nut size is selected according to the 
thickness of the parent material and the size of screw to be 
used. The part number identifies the type of rivet nut and the 
maximum grip length. Recommended hole sizes are shown 
in Figure 4-114.

Correct installation requires good hole preparation, removal 
of burrs, and holding the sheets in contact while heading. 
Like any sheet metal fastener, a rivet nut should fit snugly 
into its hole. 

Blind Fasteners (Nonstructural)
Pop Rivets

Common pull-type pop rivets, produced for non-aircraft-
related applications, are not approved for use on certificated 
aircraft structures or components. However, some homebuilt 
noncertificated aircraft use pull-type rivets for their structure. 
These types of rivets are typically made of aluminum and 
can be installed with hand tools. 


4-57

Figure 4-115. Rivetless pull-through nutplate. 

Figure 4-116. Aircraft formed at a factory.

Pull-Through Nutplate Blind Rivet

Nutplate blind rivets are used where the high shear strength 
of solid rivets is not required or if there is no access to install 
a solid rivet. The 3⁄32-inch diameter blind rivet is most often 
used. The nut plate blind rivet is available with the pull-
through and self-plugging locked spindle. [Figure 4-115] 

The new Cherry® Rivetless Nut Plate, which replaces 
standard riveted nutplates, features a retainer that does 
not require flaring. This proprietary design eliminates the 
need for two additional rivet holes, as well as reaming, 
counterboring, and countersinking steps.

Forming Process
Before a part is attached to the aircraft during either 
manufacture or repair, it has to be shaped to fit into place. 
This shaping process is called forming and may be a simple 
process, such as making one or two holes for attaching; it may 
be a complex process, such as making shapes with complex 
curvatures. Forming, which tends to change the shape or 
contour of a flat sheet or extruded shape, is accomplished by 
either stretching or shrinking the material in a certain area 
to produce curves, flanges, and various irregular shapes. 
Since the operation involves altering the shape of the stock 
material, the amount of shrinking and stretching almost 
entirely depends on the type of material used. Fully annealed 
(heated and cooled) material can withstand considerably more 
stretching and shrinking and can be formed at a much smaller 
bend radius than when it is in any of the tempered conditions.

When aircraft parts are formed at the factory, they are 
made on large presses or by drop hammers equipped with 
dies of the correct shape. Factory engineers, who designate 
specifications for the materials to be used to ensure the 
finished part has the correct temper when it leaves the 
machines, plan every part. Factory draftsmen prepare a layout 
for each part. [Figure 4-116] 

Forming processes used on the flight line and those 
practiced in the maintenance or repair shop cannot duplicate 
a manufacturer’s resources, but similar techniques of 
factory metal working can be applied in the handcrafting of  
repair parts. 

Forming usually involves the use of extremely light-gauge 
alloys of a delicate nature that can be readily made useless by 
coarse and careless workmanship. A formed part may seem 
outwardly perfect, yet a wrong step in the forming procedure 
may leave the part in a strained condition. Such a defect may 
hasten fatigue or may cause sudden structural failure.

Of all the aircraft metals, pure aluminum is the most easily 
formed. In aluminum alloys, ease of forming varies with 
the temper condition. Since modern aircraft are constructed 
chiefly of aluminum and aluminum alloys, this section deals 
with the procedures for forming aluminum or aluminum alloy 
parts with a brief discussion of working with stainless steel, 
magnesium, and titanium.

Most parts can be formed without annealing the metal, 
but if extensive forming operations, such as deep draws 
(large folds) or complex curves, are planned, the metal 
should be in the dead soft or annealed condition. During 
the forming of some complex parts, operations may need 
to be stopped and the metal annealed before the process 
can be continued or completed. For example, alloy 2024 
in the “0” condition can be formed into almost any shape 
by the common forming operations, but it must be heat  
treated afterward.

Forming Operations and Terms
Forming requires either stretching or shrinking the metal, or 
sometimes doing both. Other processes used to form metal 
include bumping, crimping, and folding.


4-58

Figure 4-117. Stretch forming metal. Figure 4-118. Shrink forming metal. 

Stretching
Stretching metal is achieved by hammering or rolling metal 
under pressure. For example, hammering a flat piece of metal 
causes the material in the hammered area to become thinner in 
that area. Since the amount of metal has not been decreased, 
the metal has been stretched. The stretching process thins, 
elongates, and curves sheet metal. It is critical to ensure the 
metal is not stretched too much, making it too thin, because 
sheet metal does not rebound easily. [Figure 4-117]

Stretching one portion of a piece of metal affects the 
surrounding material, especially in the case of formed and 
extruded angles. For example, hammering the metal in the 
horizontal flange of the angle strip over a metal block causes 
its length to increase (stretched), making that section longer 
than the section near the bend. To allow for this difference in 
length, the vertical flange, which tends to keep the material 
near the bend from stretching, would be forced to curve away 
from the greater length.

Shrinking
Shrinking metal is much more difficult than stretching it. 
During the shrinking process, metal is forced or compressed 
into a smaller area. This process is used when the length of 
a piece of metal, especially on the inside of a bend, is to be 
reduced. Sheet metal can be shrunk in by hammering on a 
V-block or by crimping and then using a shrinking block. 

To curve the formed angle by the V-block method, place the 
angle on the V-block and gently hammer downward against 
the upper edge directly over the ”V.” While hammering, move 
the angle back and forth across the V-block to compress the 
material along the upper edge. Compression of the material 
along the upper edge of the vertical flange will cause the 
formed angle to take on a curved shape. The material in the 

horizontal flange will merely bend down at the center, and 
the length of that flange will remain the same. [Figure 4-118]

To make a sharp curve or a sharply bent flanged angle, 
crimping and a shrinking block can be used. In this process, 
crimps are placed in the one flange, and then by hammering 
the metal on a shrinking block, the crimps are driven, or 
shrunk, one at a time.

Cold shrinking requires the combination of a hard surface, such 
as wood or steel, and a soft mallet or hammer because a steel 
hammer over a hard surface stretches the metal, as opposed to 
shrinking it. The larger the mallet face is, the better. 

Bumping
Bumping involves shaping or forming malleable metal by 
hammering or tapping—usually with a rubber, plastic, or 
rawhide mallet. During this process, the metal is supported by 
a dolly, a sandbag, or a die. Each contains a depression into 
which hammered portions of the metal can sink. Bumping 
can be done by hand or by machine.

Crimping
Crimping is folding, pleating, or corrugating a piece of sheet 
metal in a way that shortens it or turning down a flange on 
a seam. It is often used to make one end of a piece of stove 
pipe slightly smaller so that one section may be slipped into 
another. Crimping one side of a straight piece of angle iron 
with crimping pliers causes it to curve. [Figure 4-119] 

Folding Sheet Metal
Folding sheet metal is to make a bend or crease in sheets, 
plates, or leaves. Folds are usually thought of as sharp, 
angular bends and are generally made on folding machines 
such as the box and pan brake discussed earlier in this chapter.

Layout and Forming
Terminology 
The following terms are commonly used in sheet metal 
forming and flat pattern layout. Familiarity with these 
terms aids in understanding how bend calculations are used 
in a bending operation. Figure 4-120 illustrates most of  
these terms.

Base measurement—the outside dimensions of a formed part. 
Base measurement is given on the drawing or blueprint or 
may be obtained from the original part.

Leg—the longer part of a formed angle.

Flange—the shorter part of a formed angle—the opposite of 
leg. If each side of the angle is the same length, then each 
is known as a leg.

Grain of the metal—natural grain of the material is formed 
as the sheet is rolled from molten ingot. Bend lines should be 
made to lie at a 90º angle to the grain of the metal if possible.

Bend allowance (BA)—refers to the curved section of 
metal within the bend (the portion of metal that is curved in 
bending). The bend allowance may be considered as being 
the length of the curved portion of the neutral line. 

Bend radius—the arc is formed when sheet metal is bent. This 
arc is called the bend radius. The bend radius is measured 
from a radius center to the inside surface of the metal. The 
minimum bend radius depends on the temper, thickness, and 
type of material. Always use a Minimum Bend Radius Table 
to determine the minimum bend radius for the alloy that is 
going to be used. Minimum bend radius charts can be found 
in manufacturer’s maintenance manuals. 

Bend tangent line (BL)—the location at which the metal starts 
to bend and the line at which the metal stops curving. All the 
space between the band tangent lines is the bend allowance.

Neutral axis—an imaginary line that has the same length 
after bending as it had before bending. [Figure 4-121] After 
bending, the bend area is 10 to 15 percent thinner than before 
bending. This thinning of the bend area moves the neutral 
line of the metal in towards the radius center. For calculation 
purposes, it is often assumed that the neutral axis is located 
at the center of the material, although the neutral axis is not 
exactly in the center of the material. However, the amount 
of error incurred is so slight that, for most work, assuming 
it is at the center is satisfactory.

Mold line (ML)—an extension of the flat side of a part 
beyond the radius.


4-60

Neutral line

Figure 4-121. Neutral line.

Mold line dimension (MLD)—the dimension of a part made 
by the intersection of mold lines. It is the dimension the part 
would have if its corners had no radius. 

Mold point—the point of intersection of the mold lines. The 
mold point would be the outside corner of the part if there 
were no radius.

K-Factor—the percentage of the material thickness where 
there is no stretching or compressing of the material, such as 
the neutral axis. This percentage has been calculated and is 
one of 179 numbers on the K chart corresponding to one of 
the angles between 0° and 180° to which metal can be bent. 
[Figure 4-122] Whenever metal is to be bent to any angle 
other than 90° (K-factor of 90° equal to 1), the corresponding 
K-factor number is selected from the chart and is multiplied 
by the sum of the radius (R) and the thickness (T) of the metal. 
The product is the amount of setback (see next paragraph) 
for the bend. If no K chart is available, the K-factor can be 
calculated with a calculator by using the following formula: 
the K value is the tangent of one-half the bend angle.

Setback (SB)—the distance the jaws of a brake must be 
setback from the mold line to form a bend. In a 90° bend, 
SB = R + T (radius of the bend plus thickness of the metal). 
The setback dimension must be determined prior to making 
the bend because setback is used in determining the location 
of the beginning bend tangent line. When a part has more 
than one bend, setback must be subtracted for each bend. The 
majority of bends in sheet metal are 90° bends. The K-factor 
must be used for all bends that are smaller or larger than 90°.

SB = K(R+T)

Sight line—also called the bend or brake line, it is the layout 
line on the metal being formed that is set even with the nose 
of the brake and serves as a guide in bending the work.

Flat—that portion of a part that is not included in the bend. It 
is equal to the base measurement (MLD) minus the setback.

Flat = MLD – SB

Closed angle—an angle that is less than 90° when measured 
between legs, or more than 90° when the amount of bend is 
measured.

Open angle—an angle that is more than 90° when measured 
between legs, or less than 90° when the amount of bend is 
measured.

Total developed width (TDW)—the width of material 
measured around the bends from edge to edge. Finding the 
TDW is necessary to determine the size of material to be 
cut. The TDW is less than the sum of mold line dimensions 
since the metal is bent on a radius and not to a square corner 
as mold line dimensions indicate. 

Layout or Flat Pattern Development
To prevent any waste of material and to get a greater degree 
of accuracy in the finished part, it is wise to make a layout 
or flat pattern of a part before forming it. Construction of 
interchangeable structural and nonstructural parts is achieved 
by forming flat sheet stock to make channel, angle, zee, or 
hat section members. Before a sheet metal part is formed, 
make a flat pattern to show how much material is required 
in the bend areas, at what point the sheet must be inserted 
into the forming tool, or where bend lines are located. Bend 
lines must be determined to develop a flat pattern for sheet 
metal forming.

When forming straight angle bends, correct allowances 
must be made for setback and bend allowance. If shrinking 
or stretching processes are to be used, allowances must be 
made so that the part can be turned out with a minimum 
amount of forming. 

Making Straight Line Bends
When forming straight bends, the thickness of the material, 
its alloy composition, and its temper condition must be 
considered. Generally speaking, the thinner the material is, 
the more sharply it can be bent (the smaller the radius of 
bend), and the softer the material is, the sharper the bend 
is. Other factors that must be considered when making 
straight line bends are bend allowance, setback, and brake or  
sight line.

The radius of bend of a sheet of material is the radius of the 
bend as measured on the inside of the curved material. The 
minimum radius of bend of a sheet of material is the sharpest 
curve, or bend, to which the sheet can be bent without 
critically weakening the metal at the bend. If the radius of 
bend is too small, stresses and strains weaken the metal and 
may result in cracking.

Figure 4-123. U-channel example.

A minimum radius of bend is specified for each type of 
aircraft sheet metal. The minimum bend radius is affected 
by the kind of material, thickness of the material, and temper 
condition of the material. Annealed sheet can be bent to a 
radius approximately equal to its thickness. Stainless steel and 
2024-T3 aluminum alloy require a fairly large bend radius. 

Bending a U-Channel
To understand the process of making a sheet metal layout, 
the steps for determining the layout of a sample U-channel 
will be discussed. [Figure 4-123] When using bend

allowance calculations, the following steps for finding the 
total developed length can be computed with formulas, 
charts, or computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided 
manufacturing (CAM) software packages. This channel is 
made of 0.040-inch 2024-T3 aluminum alloy.

Step 1: Determine the Correct Bend Radius

Minimum bend radius charts are found in manufacturers’ 
maintenance manuals. A radius that is too sharp cracks the 
material during the bending process. Typically, the drawing 
indicates the radius to use, but it is a good practice to double 
check. For this layout example, use the minimum radius 
chart in Figure 4-124 to choose the correct bend radius for 
the alloy, temper, and the metal thickness. For 0.040, 2024-
T3 the minimum allowable radius is 0.16-inch or 5⁄32-inch.

Step 2: Find the Setback

The setback can be calculated with a formula or can be found 
in a setback chart available in aircraft maintenance manuals 
or Source, Maintenance, and Recoverability books (SMRs). 
[Figure 4-125]

Using a Formula to Calculate the Setback

SB = setback

K = K-factor (K is 1 for 90° bends)

R = inside radius of the bend

T = material thickness

Since all of the angles in this example are 90° angles, the 
setback is calculated as follows:

 SB = K(R+T) = 0.2 inches

NOTE: K = 1 for a 90° bend. For other than a 90° bend, use 
a K-factor chart.

Using a Setback Chart to Find the Setback

The setback chart is a quick way to find the setback and is 
useful for open and closed bends, because there is no need 
to calculate or find the K-factor. Several software packages 
and online calculators are available to calculate the setback. 
These programs are often used with CAD/CAM programs.

• Find the setback from corresponding scale on the left.

• Bend angle is 135°.

• R + T = 0.183-inch. 

Find 0.183 at the bottom of the graph. It is found in the 
middle scale.

• Read up to a bend angle of 135°.

• Locate the setback at the left hand side of the graph 
in the middle scale (0.435-inch). [Figure 4-125]

Step 3: Find the Length of the Flat Line Dimension

The flat line dimension can be found using the formula: 

Flat = MLD – SB

MLD = mold line dimension

SB = setback

The flats, or flat portions of the U-channel, are equal to the 
mold line dimension minus the setback for each of the sides, 
and the mold line length minus two setbacks for the center 
flat. Two setbacks need to be subtracted from the center flat 
because this flat has a bend on either side. 

The flat dimension for the sample U-channel is calculated in 
the following manner:

Flat dimension = MLD – SB

Flat 1 = 1.00-inch – 0.2-inch = 0.8-inch

Flat 2 = 2.00-inch – (2 × 0.2-inch) = 1.6-inch

Flat 3 = 1.00-inch – 0.2-inch = 0.8-inch

Step 4: Find the Bend Allowance

When making a bend or fold in a piece of metal, the bend 
allowance or length of material required for the bend must be 
calculated. Bend allowance depends on four factors: degree 
of bend, radius of the bend, thickness of the metal, and type 
of metal used.

The radius of the bend is generally proportional to the 
thickness of the material. Furthermore, the sharper the radius 
of bend, the less the material that is needed for the bend. The 
type of material is also important. If the material is soft, it 
can be bent very sharply; but if it is hard, the radius of bend 
is greater, and the bend allowance is greater. The degree 

of bend affects the overall length of the metal, whereas the 
thickness influences the radius of bend.

Bending a piece of metal compresses the material on the 
inside of the curve and stretches the material on the outside 
of the curve. However, at some distance between these 
two extremes lies a space which is not affected by either 
force. This is known as the neutral line or neutral axis and 
occurs at a distance approximately 0.445 times the metal 
thickness (0.445 × T) from the inside of the radius of the 
bend. [Figure 4-126]

The length of this neutral axis must be determined so that 
sufficient material can be provided for the bend. This is called 
the bend allowance. This amount must be added to the overall 
length of the layout pattern to ensure adequate material for 
the bend. To save time in calculation of the bend allowance, 
formulas and charts for various angles, radii of bends, 
material thicknesses, and other factors have been developed. 

Formula 1: Bend Allowance for a 90° Bend

To the radius of bend (R) add 1⁄2 the thickness of the metal 
(1⁄2T). This gives R + 1⁄2T, or the radius of the circle of the 
neutral axis. [Figure 4-127] Compute the circumference 
of this circle by multiplying the radius of the neutral line 
(R + 1⁄2T) by 2π (NOTE: π = 3.1416): 2π (R + 1⁄2T). Since a 
90° bend is a quarter of the circle, divide the circumference 
by 4. This gives:
 

2π (R + 1⁄2T)
4

This is the bend allowance for a 90° bend. To use the formula 
for a 90° bend having a radius of 1⁄4 inch for material 0.051-
inch thick, substitute in the formula as follows.

Bend allowance = (2 × 3.1416)(0.250 + 1⁄2(0.051))
    4  

= 6.2832(0.250 + 0.0255)
4

= 6.2832(0.2755)
4

= 0.4327

The bend allowance, or the length of material required for 
the bend, is 0.4327 or 7⁄16-inch.

Formula 2: Bend Allowance for a 90° Bend

This formula uses two constant values that have evolved over 
a period of years as being the relationship of the degrees in the 
bend to the thickness of the metal when determining the bend

with actual bends in metals, aircraft engineers have found 
that accurate bending results could be obtained by using the 
following formula for any degree of bend from 1° to 180°.

To use this formula for a 90° bend having a radius of .16-
inch for material 0.040-inch thick, substitute in the formula 
as follows:

Bend allowance =
(0.01743 × 0.16) + (0.0078 × 0.040) × 90 = 0.27 inches

Use of Bend Allowance Chart for a 90° Bend

In Figure 4-128, the radius of bend is shown on the top line, 
and the metal thickness is shown on the left hand column. 
The upper number in each cell is the bend allowance for a 
90° bend. The lower number in the cell is the bend allowance 
per 1° of bend. To determine the bend allowance for a 90° 
bend, simply use the top number in the chart.

Example: The material thickness of the U-channel is 0.040-
inch and the bend radius is 0.16-inch.

Reading across the top of the bend allowance chart, find 
the column for a radius of bend of .156-inch. Now, find the 
block in this column that is opposite the material thickness 
(gauge) of 0.040 in the column at the left. The upper number 
in the cell is (0.273), the correct bend allowance in inches 
for a 90° bends.

Several bend allowance calculation programs are available 
online. Just enter the material thickness, radius, and degree 
of bend and the computer program calculates the bend 
allowance.

Use of Chart for Other Than a 90° Bend

If the bend is to be other than 90°, use the lower number in 
the block (the bend allowance for 1°) and compute the bend 
allowance. 

Example:
The L-bracket shown in Figure 4-129 is made from 2024-T3 
aluminum alloy and the bend is 60° from flat. Note that the 
bend angle in the figure indicates 120°, but that is the number 
of degrees between the two flanges and not the bend angle 
from flat. To find the correct bend angle, use the following 
formula: 

Bend Angle = 180° – Angle between flanges

The actual bend is 60°. To find the correct bend radius for a 
60° bend of material 0.040-inches thick, use the following 
procedure.

1. Go to the left side of the table and find 0.040-inch.

2. Go to the right and locate the bend radius of 0.16-inch 
(0.156-inch). 

3. Note the bottom number in the block (0.003034). 

4. Multiply this number by the bend angle:
 0.003034 × 60 = 0.18204

Step 5: Find the Total Developed Width of the Material

The total developed width (TDW) can be calculated when 
the dimensions of the flats and the bend allowance are found. 
The following formula is used to calculate TDW:

TDW = Flats + (bend allowance × number of bends)

For the U-channel example, this gives:

TDW = Flat 1 + Flat 2 + Flat 3 + (2 × BA)

TDW = 0.8 + 1.6 + 0.8 + (2 × 0.27)

TDW = 3.74-inches

Note that the amount of metal needed to make the channel 
is less than the dimensions of the outside of the channel 
(total of mold line dimensions is 4 inches). This is because 
the metal follows the radius of the bend rather than going 
from mold line to mold line. It is good practice to check 
that the calculated TDW is smaller than the total mold line 
dimensions. If the calculated TDW is larger than the mold 
line dimensions, the math was incorrect. 

Step 6: Flat Pattern Lay Out

After a flat pattern layout of all relevant information is made, 
the material can be cut to the correct size, and the bend tangent 
lines can be drawn on the material. [Figure 4-130]

Step 7: Draw the Sight Lines on the Flat Pattern

The pattern laid out in Figure 4-130 is complete, except 
for a sight line that needs to be drawn to help position 
the bend tangent line directly at the point where the bend 
should start. Draw a line inside the bend allowance area that 
is one bend radius away from the bend tangent line that is 
placed under the brake nose bar. Put the metal in the brake 
under the clamp and adjust the position of the metal until 
the sight line is directly below the edge of the radius bar. 
[Figure 4-131] Now, clamp the brake on the metal and raise 

the leaf to make the bend. The bend begins exactly on the 
bend tangent line. 

NOTE: A common mistake is to draw the sight line in the 
middle of the bend allowance area, instead of one radius 
away from the bend tangent line that is placed under the 
brake nose bar.

Using a J-Chart To Calculate Total Developed Width
The J-chart, often found in the SRM, can be used to determine 
bend deduction or setback and the TDW of a flat pattern 
layout when the inside bend radius, bend angle, and material 
thickness are known. [Figure 4-132] While not as accurate as 
the traditional layout method, the J-chart provides sufficient 
information for most applications. The J-chart does not 
require difficult calculations or memorized formulas because 
the required information can be found in the repair drawing 
or can be measured with simple measuring tools.

Instruction
Place a straightedge across the chart connecting the radius on the upper scale and
thickness on lower scale. Then, locate the angle on the right hand scale and follow
this line horizontally until it meets the straight edge. The factor X is then read on the
diagonally curving line. Interpolate when the factor X falls between lines.

Figure 4-132. J chart. 

When using the J-chart, it is helpful to know whether the 
angle is open (greater than 90°) or closed (less than 90°) 
because the lower half of the J-chart is for open angles and 
the upper half is for closed angles.

How To Find the Total Developed Width Using a 
J-Chart

• Place a straightedge across the chart and connect the 
bend radius on the top scale with the material thickness 
on the bottom scale. [Figure 4-132]

• Locate the angle on the right hand scale and follow 
this line horizontally until it meets the straight edge.

• The factor X (bend deduction) is then read on the 
diagonally curving line.

• Interpolate when the X factor falls between lines.

• Add up the mold line dimensions and subtract the X 
factor to find the TDW.

Bend radius = 0.22-inch

Material thickness = 0.063-inch

Bend angle = 90º

ML 1 = 2.00/ML 2 = 2.00

Use a straightedge to connect the bend radius (0.22-inch) at 
the top of the graph with the material thickness at the bottom 
(0.063-inch). Locate the 90° angle on the right hand scale and 
follow this line horizontally until it meets the straightedge. 
Follow the curved line to the left and find 0.17 at the left side. 
The X factor in the drawing is 0.17-inch. [Figure 4-133]

Total developed width =

Figure 4-134 illustrates a 135° angle, but this is the angle 
between the two legs. The actual bend from flat position is 
45° (180 – 135 = 45). Use a straightedge to connect the bend 
radius (0.25-inch) at the top of the graph with the material 
thickness at the bottom (.050-inch). Locate the 45° angle on 
the right hand scale and follow this line horizontally until 
it meets the straight edge. Follow the curved line to the left 
and find 0.035 at the left side. The X factor in the drawing 
is 0.035 inch. 

Total developed width =
(Mold line 1 + Mold line 2) – X factor

Total developed width = (2 + 2) – .035 = 3.965-inch

Using a Sheet Metal Brake to Fold Metal
The brake set up for box and pan brakes and cornice brakes 
is identical. [Figure 4-135] A proper set up of the sheet 
metal brake is necessary because accurate bending of sheet 
metal depends on the thickness and temper of the material 
to be formed and the required radius of the part. Any time a 
different thickness of sheet metal needs to be formed or when 
a different radius is required to form the part, the operator 
needs to adjust the sheet metal brake before the brake is 
used to form the part. For this example, an L-channel made 
from 2024 –T3 aluminum alloy that is 0.032-inch thick will 
be bent.

Step 1: Adjustment of Bend Radius
The bend radius necessary to bend a part can be found in 
the part drawings, but if it is not mentioned in the drawing, 
consult the SRM for a minimum bend radius chart. This 
chart lists the smallest radius allowable for each thickness 
and temper of metal that is normally used. To bend tighter 
than this radius would jeopardize the integrity of the part. 
Stresses left in the area of the bend may cause it to fail while 
in service, even if it does not crack while bending it.

NOSE RADIUS
BAR

Each of these nose radius shims 
is 0.063 inch thick, which gives 
radius choices of 1/8"", 3/16"", and 1/4""

This radius shim builds radius 
to precisely 1/16""R

Figure 4-136. Interchangeable brake radius bars.

Figure 4-137. Nose radius shims may be used when the brake radius bar is smaller than required.

The brake radius bars of a sheet metal brake can be replaced 
with another brake radius bar with a different diameter. 
[Figure 4-136] For example, a 0.032-inch 2024-T3 L channel 
needs to be bent with a radius of 1⁄8-inch and a radius bar with 
a 1⁄8-inch radius must be installed. If different brake radius 
bars are not available, and the installed brake radius bar is 
smaller than required for the part, it is necessary to bend 
some nose radius shims. [Figure 4-137]

If the radius is so small that it tends to crack annealed 
aluminum, mild steel is a good choice of material. 
Experimentation with a small piece of scrap material is 
necessary to manufacture a thickness that increases the radius 
to precisely 1⁄16-inch or 1⁄8-inch. Use radius and fillet gauges 

to check this dimension. From this point on, each additional 
shim is added to the radius before it. [Figure 4-138]

Example: If the original nose was 1⁄16-inch and a piece of .063-
inch material (1⁄16-inch) was bent around it, the new outside 
radius is 1⁄8-inch. If another .063-inch layer (1⁄16-inch) is added, 
it is now a 3⁄16-inch radius. If a piece of .032-inch (1⁄32-inch) 
instead of .063-inch material (1⁄16-inch) is bent around the 
1⁄8-inch radius, a 5⁄32-inch radius results. 

Step 2: Adjusting Clamping Pressure
The next step is setting clamping pressure. Slide a piece of 
the material with the same thickness as the part to be bent 
under the brake radius piece. Pull the clamping lever toward 
the operator to test the pressure. This is an over center type 
clamp and, when properly set, will not feel springy or spongy 
when pulled to its fully clamped position. The operator must 
be able to pull this lever over center with a firm pull and have 
it bump its limiting stops. On some brakes, this adjustment 
has to be made on both sides of the brake. 

Place test strips on the table 3 inches from each end and one 
in the center between the bed and the clamp, adjust clamp 
pressure until it is tight enough to prevent the work pieces 
from slipping while bending. The clamping pressure can 
be adjusted with the clamping pressure nut. [Figure 4-139]

same thickness as part to be formed. 

Step 3: Adjusting the Nose Gap
Adjust the nose gap by turning the large brake nose gap 
adjustment knobs at the rear of the upper jaw to achieve 
its proper alignment. [Figure 4-140] The perfect setting 
is obtained when the bending leaf is held up to the angle 
of the finished bend and there is one material thickness 
between the bending leaf and the nose radius piece. Using 

a piece of material the thickness of the part to be bent as a 
feeler gauge can help achieve a high degree of accuracy. 
[Figures 4-140 and 4-141] It is essential this nose gap be 
perfect, even across the length of the part to be bent. Check 
by clamping two test strips between the bed and the clamp 3 
inches from each end of the brake. [Figure 4-142] Bend 90°

match, adjust the end with the sharper bend back slightly. 

Folding a Box
A box can be formed the same way as the U-channel described 
on in the previous paragraphs, but when a sheet metal part 
has intersecting bend radii, it is necessary to remove material 
to make room for the material contained in the flanges. This 
is done by drilling or punching holes at the intersection of 
the inside bend tangent lines. These holes, called relief holes 
and whose diameter is approximately twice the bend radius, 
relieve stresses in the metal as it is bent and prevent the metal 
from tearing. Relief holes also provide a neatly trimmed corner 
from which excess material may be trimmed.

The larger and smoother the relief hole is, the less likely it 
will be that a crack will form in the corner. Generally, the 
radius of the relief hole is specified on the drawing. A box 
and pan brake, also called a finger brake, is used to bend the 
box. Two opposite sides of the box are bent first. Then, the 
fingers of the brake are adjusted so the folded-up sides ride 
up in the cracks between the fingers when the leaf is raised 
to bend the other two sides. 

The size of relief holes varies with thickness of the material. 
They should be no less than 1⁄8-inch in diameter for aluminum 
alloy sheet stock up to and including 0.064-inch thick, or 
3⁄160-inch in diameter for stock ranging from 0.072-inch 
to 0.128-inch thickness. The most common method of 
determining the diameter of a relief hole is to use the radius 
of bend for this dimension, provided it is not less than the 
minimum allowance (1⁄8-inch).

Relief Hole Location
Relief holes must touch the intersection of the inside bend 
tangent lines. To allow for possible error in bending, make 
the relief holes extend 1⁄32-inch to 1⁄16-inch behind the inside 
bend tangent lines. It is good practice to use the intersection 
of these lines as the center for the holes. The line on the inside 
of the curve is cut at an angle toward the relief holes to allow 
for the stretching of the inside flange.

The positioning of the relief hole is important. [Figure 4-145] 
It should be located so its outer perimeter touches the 

intersection of the inside bend tangent lines. This keeps any 
material from interfering with the bend allowance area of the 
other bend. If these bend allowance areas intersected with 
each other, there would be substantial compressive stresses 
that would accumulate in that corner while bending. This 
could cause the part to crack while bending.

Layout Method
Lay out the basic part using traditional layout procedures. 
This determines the width of the flats and the bend allowance. 
It is the intersection of the inside bend tangent lines that index 
the bend relief hole position. Bisect these intersected lines 
and move outward the distance of the radius of the hole on 
this line. This is the center of the hole. Drill at this point and 
finish by trimming off the remainder of the corner material. 
The trim out is often tangent to the radius and perpendicular 
to the edge. [Figure 4-146] This leaves an open corner. If the  
corner must be closed, or a slightly longer flange is necessary, 
then trim out accordingly. If the corner is to be welded, it 
is necessary to have touching flanges at the corners. The 
length of the flange should be one material thickness shorter 
than the finished length of the part so only the insides of the 
flanges touch. 

Open and Closed Bends
Open and closed bends present unique problems that require 
more calculations than 90° bends. In the following 45° and 
a 135° bend examples, the material is 0.050-inch thick and 
the bend radius is 3⁄16-inch.

Figure 4-147 shows an example for a 45° bend.

1. Look up K-factor in K chart. K-factor for 45° is 
0.41421-inch.

2. Calculate setback.

 SB = K(R + T)

 SB = 0.41421-inch(0.1875-inch + 0.050-inch) = 
0.098-inch

3. Calculate bend allowance for 45°. Look up bend 
allowance for 1° of bend in the bend allowance chart 
and multiply this by 45.   

 0.003675-inch × 45 = 0.165-inch

4. Calculate flats. 

 Flat = Mold line dimension – SB

 Flat 1 = .77-inch – 0.098-inch = 0.672-inch

 Flat 2 = 1.52-inch – 0.098-inch = 1.422-inch

5. Calculate TDW

 TDW = Flats + Bend allowance

 TDW = 0.672-inch + 1.422-inch + 0.165-inch = 2.259-inch.

Observe that the brake reference line is still located one radius 
from the bend tangent line. 

Closed End Bend (More Than 90°)
Figure 4-148 shows an example of a 135° bend.

1. Look up K-factor in K chart. K-factor for 135° is 
2.4142-inch.

2. Calculate SB.

 SB = K(R + T)

 SB = 2.4142-inch(0.1875-inch + 0.050-inch) = 0.57-
inch

3. Calculate bend allowance for 135°. Look up bend 
allowance for 1° of bend in the bend allowance chart 
and multiply this by 135. 

 0.003675-inch × 135 = 0.496-inch

4. Calculate flats. 

 Flat = Mold line dimension – SB

 Flat 1 = 0.77-inch – 0.57-inch = 0.20-inch 

 Flat 2 = 1.52-inch – 0.57-inch = 0.95-inch

5. Calculate TDW.

 TDW = Flats + Bend allowance

 TDW = 0.20-inch + 0.95-inch + 0.496-inch = 1.65-
inch

It is obvious from both examples that a closed bend has a 
smaller TDW than an open-end bend and the material length 
needs to be adjusted accordingly.

Hand Forming
All hand forming revolves around the processes of stretching 
and shrinking metal. As discussed earlier, stretching means to 
lengthen or increase a particular area of metal while shrinking 
means to reduce an area. Several methods of stretching and 
shrinking may be used, depending on the size, shape, and 
contour of the part being formed.

For example, if a formed or extruded angle is to be curved, 
either stretch one leg or shrink the other, whichever makes 
the part fit. In bumping, the material is stretched in the bulge 
to make it balloon, and in joggling, the material is stretched 
between the joggles. Material in the edge of lightning holes 
is often stretched to form a beveled reinforcing ridge around 
them. The following paragraphs discuss some of these 
techniques.

Straight Line Bends
The cornice brake and bar folder are ordinarily used to make 
straight bends. Whenever such machines are not available, 
comparatively short sections can be bent by hand with the 
aid of wooden or metal bending blocks.

After a blank has been laid out and cut to size, clamp it along 
the bend line between two wooden forming blocks held in 


4-75

Figure 4-149. V-block forming. 

a vise. The wooden forming blocks should have one edge 
rounded as needed for the desired radius of bend. It should 
also be curved slightly beyond 90° to allow for spring-back. 

Bend the metal that protrudes beyond the bending block to 
the desired angle by tapping lightly with a rubber, plastic, 
or rawhide mallet. Start tapping at one end and work back 
and forth along the edge to make a gradual and even bend. 
Continue this process until the protruding metal is bent to the 
desired angle against the forming block. Allow for spring-
back by driving the material slightly farther than the actual 
bend. If a large amount of metal extends beyond the forming 
blocks, maintain hand pressure against the protruding sheet 
to prevent it from bouncing. Remove any irregularities by 
holding a straight block of hardwood edgewise against the 
bend and striking it with heavy blows of a mallet or hammer. 
If the amount of metal protruding beyond the bending blocks 
is small, make the entire bend by using the hardwood block 
and hammer.

Formed or Extruded Angles
Both formed and extruded types of angles can be curved (not 
bent sharply) by stretching or shrinking either of the flanges. 
Curving by stretching one flange is usually preferred since 
the process requires only a V-block and a mallet and is easily 
accomplished.

Stretching with V-Block Method

In the stretching method, place the flange to be stretched in 
the groove of the V-block. [Figure 4-149] (If the flange is 
to be shrunk, place the flange across the V-block.) Using a 

round, soft-faced mallet, strike the flange directly over the 
V portion with light, even blows while gradually forcing it 
downward into the V. 

Begin at one end of the flange and form the curve gradually 
and evenly by moving the strip slowly back and forth, 
distributing the hammer blows at equal spaces on the 
flange. Hold the strip firmly to keep it from bouncing when 
hammered. An overly heavy blow buckles the metal, so keep 
moving the flange across the V-block, but always lightly strike 
the spot directly above the V. 

Lay out a full-sized, accurate pattern on a sheet of paper or 
plywood and periodically check the accuracy of the curve. 
Comparing the angle with the pattern determines exactly 
how the curve is progressing and just where it needs to be 
increased or decreased. It is better to get the curve to conform 
roughly to the desired shape before attempting to finish any 
one portion, because the finishing or smoothing of the angle 
may cause some other portion of the angle to change shape. 
If any part of the angle strip is curved too much, reduce the 
curve by reversing the angle strip on the V-block, placing the 
bottom flange up, and striking it with light blows of the mallet.

Try to form the curve with a minimum amount of hammering, 
for excessive hammering work hardens the metal. Work-
hardening can be recognized by a lack of bending response or 
by springiness in the metal. It can be recognized very readily 
by an experienced worker. In some cases, the part may have 
to be annealed during the curving operation. If so, be sure 
to heat treat the part again before installing it on the aircraft.

Shrinking With V-Block and Shrinking Block Methods

Curving an extruded or formed angle strip by shrinking may 
be accomplished by either the previously discussed V-block 
method or the shrinking block method. While the V-block 
is more satisfactory because it is faster, easier, and affects 
the metal less, good results can be obtained by the shrinking 
block method.

In the V-block method, place one flange of the angle strip 
flat on the V-block with the other flange extending upward. 
Using the process outlined in the stretching paragraphs, begin 
at one end of the angle strip and work back and forth making 
light blows. Strike the edge of the flange at a slight angle to 
keep the vertical flange from bending outward. 

Occasionally, check the curve for accuracy with the pattern. 
If a sharp curve is made, the angle (cross-section of the 
formed angle) closes slightly. To avoid such closing of the 
angle, clamp the angle strip to a hardwood board with the 
hammered flange facing upward using small C-clamps. The

Form blocks

jaws of the C-clamps should be covered with masking tape. 
If the angle has already closed, bring the flange back to the 
correct angle with a few blows of a mallet or with the aid 
of a small hardwood block. If any portion of the angle strip 
is curved too much, reduce it by reversing the angle on the 
V-block and hammering with a suitable mallet, as explained 
in the previous paragraph on stretching. After obtaining the 
proper curve, smooth the entire angle by planishing with a 
soft-faced mallet.

If the curve in a formed angle is to be quite sharp or if the 
flanges of the angle are rather broad, the shrinking block 
method is generally used. In this process, crimp the flange 
that is to form the inside of the curve.

When making a crimp, hold the crimping pliers so that the 
jaws are about 1⁄8-inch apart. By rotating the wrist back and 
forth, bring the upper jaw of the pliers into contact with the 
flange, first on one side and then on the other side of the 
lower jaw. Complete the crimp by working a raised portion 
into the flange, gradually increasing the twisting motion of 
the pliers. Do not make the crimp too large because it will 
be difficult to work out. The size of the crimp depends upon 
the thickness and softness of the material, but usually about 
1⁄4-inch is sufficient. Place several crimps spaced evenly along 
the desired curve with enough space left between each crimp 
so that jaws of the shrinking block can easily be attached.

After completing the crimping, place the crimped flange in 
the shrinking block so that one crimp at a time is located 
between the jaws. [Figure 4-150] Flatten each crimp with 
light blows of a soft-faced mallet, starting at the apex (the 
closed end) of the crimp and gradually working toward the 
edge of the flange. Check the curve of the angle with the 
pattern periodically during the forming process and again 

after all the crimps have been worked out. If it is necessary to 
increase the curve, add more crimps and repeat the process. 
Space the additional crimps between the original ones so that 
the metal does not become unduly work hardened at any one 
point. If the curve needs to be increased or decreased slightly 
at any point, use the V-block.

After obtaining the desired curve, planish the angle strip over 
a stake or a wooden form.

Flanged Angles
The forming process for the following two flanged angles 
is slightly more complicated than the previously discussed 
angles because the bend is shorter (not gradually curved) and 
necessitates shrinking or stretching in a small or concentrated 
area. If the flange is to point toward the inside of the bend, the 
material must be shrunk. If it is to point toward the outside, 
it must be stretched. 

Shrinking
In forming a flanged angle by shrinking, use wooden forming 
blocks similar to those shown in Figure 4-151 and proceed 
as follows:

1. Cut the metal to size, allowing for trimming after 
forming. Determine the bend allowance for a 90° bend 
and round the edge of the forming block accordingly.

2. Clamp the material in the form blocks as shown in 
Figure 4-151, and bend the exposed flange against 
the block. After bending, tap the blocks slightly. This 
induces a setting process in the bend.  


4-77

Figure 4-152. Shrinking.

Figure 4-153. Stretching a flanged angle. 

Figure 4-154. Forming blocks. 

3. Using a soft-faced shrinking mallet, start hammering 
near the center and work the flange down gradually 
toward both ends. The flange tends to buckle at the 
bend because the material is made to occupy less 
space. Work the material into several small buckles 
instead of one large one and work each buckle 
out gradually by hammering lightly and gradually 
compressing the material in each buckle. The use of 
a small hardwood wedge block aids in working out 
the buckles. [Figure 4-152]

4. Planish the flange after it is flattened against the form 
block and remove small irregularities. If the form blocks 
are made of hardwood, use a metal planishing hammer. 
If the forms are made of metal, use a soft-faced mallet. 
Trim the excess material away and file and polish.

Stretching
To form a flanged angle by stretching, use the same forming 
blocks, wooden wedge block, and mallet as used in the 
shrinking process and proceed as follows:

1. Cut the material to size (allowing for trim), determine 
bend allowance for a 90° bend, and round off the edge 
of the block to conform to the desired radius of bend.

2. Clamp the material in the form blocks. [Figure 4-153]

3. Using a soft-faced stretching mallet, start hammering 
near the ends and work the flange down smoothly and 
gradually to prevent cracking and splitting. Planish 
the flange and angle as described in the previous 
procedure, and trim and smooth the edges, if necessary.

 
Curved Flanged Parts
Curved flanged parts are usually hand formed with a concave 
flange, the inside edge, and a convex flange, the outside edge. 

The concave flange is formed by stretching, while the 
convex flange is formed by shrinking. Such parts are 
shaped with the aid of hardwood or metal forming blocks. 
[Figure 4-154] These blocks are made in pairs and are

designed specifically for the shape of the area being 
formed. These blocks are made in pairs similar to those 
used for straight angle bends and are identified in the same 
manner. They differ in that they are made specifically for 
the particular part to be formed, they fit each other exactly, 
and they conform to the actual dimensions and contour of 
the finished article.

The forming blocks may be equipped with small aligning 
pins to help line up the blocks and to hold the metal in place 
or they may be held together by C-clamps or a vise. They 
also may be held together with bolts by drilling through form 
blocks and the metal, provided the holes do not affect the 
strength of the finished part. The edges of the forming block 
are rounded to give the correct radius of bend to the part, and 
are undercut approximately 5° to allow for spring-back of the 
metal. This undercut is especially important if the material 
is hard or if the bend must be accurate.

The nose rib offers a good example of forming a curved 
flange because it incorporates both stretching and shrinking 
(by crimping). They usually have a concave flange, the 
inside edge, and a convex flange, the outside edge. Note 
the various types of forming represented in the following 
figures. In the plain nose rib, only one large convex flange 
is used. [Figure 4-155] Because of the great distance around 
the part and the likelihood of buckles in forming, it is rather 
difficult to form. The flange and the beaded (raised ridge 
on sheet metal used to stiffen the piece) portion of this rib 
provide sufficient strength to make this a good type to use. 
In Figure 4-156, the concave flange is difficult to form, but 
the outside flange is broken up into smaller sections by relief 
holes. In Figure 4-157, note that crimps are placed at equally 
spaced intervals to absorb material and cause curving, while 
also giving strength to the part.

In Figure 4-158, the nose rib is formed by crimping, beading, 
putting in relief holes, and using a formed angle riveted on 

each end. The beads and the formed angles supply strength to 
the part. The basic steps in forming a curved flange follow:

1. Cut the material to size, allowing about 1⁄4-inch excess 
material for trim and drill holes for alignment pins.

2. Remove all burrs (jagged edges). This reduces the 
possibility of the material cracking at the edges during 
the forming process.

3. Locate and drill holes for alignment pins.

4. Place the material between the form blocks and 
clamp blocks tightly in a vise to prevent the material 
from moving or shifting. Clamp the work as closely 
as possible to the particular area being hammered to 
prevent strain on the form blocks and to keep the metal 
from slipping.

Concave Surfaces

Bend the flange on the concave curve first. This practice 
may keep the flange from splitting open or cracking when 
the metal is stretched. Should this occur, a new piece must 
be made. Using a plastic or rawhide mallet with a smooth, 
slightly rounded face, start hammering at the extreme ends 
of the part and continue toward the center of the bend. This 
procedure permits some of the metal at the ends of the part 
to be worked into the center of the curve where it is needed. 
Continue hammering until the metal is gradually worked 
down over the entire flange, flush with the form block. After 
the flange is formed, trim off the excess material and check 
the part for accuracy. [Figure 4-159]

Convex Surfaces

Convex surfaces are formed by shrinking the material over 
a form block. [Figure 4-160] Using a wooden or plastic 
shrinking mallet and a backup or wedge block, start at the 
center of the curve and work toward both ends. Hammer the 

flange down over the form, striking the metal with glancing 
blows at an angle of approximately 45° and with a motion 
that tends to pull the part away from the radius of the form 
block. Stretch the metal around the radius bend and remove 
the buckles gradually by hammering on a wedge block. Use 
the backup block to keep the edge of the flange as nearly 
perpendicular to the form block as possible. The backup block 
also lessens the possibility of buckles, splits, or cracks. Finally, 
trim the flanges of excess metal, planish, remove burrs, round 
the corners (if any), and check the part for accuracy.

Forming by Bumping
As discussed earlier, bumping involves stretching the sheet 
metal by bumping it into a form and making it balloon. 
[Figure 4-161] Bumping can be done on a form block or 
female die, or on a sandbag.

Figure 4-161. Form block bumping.

Either method requires only one form: a wooden block, a lead 
die, or a sandbag. The blister, or streamlined cover plate, is 
an example of a part made by the form block or die method 
of bumping. Wing fillets are an example of parts that are 
usually formed by bumping on a sandbag. 

Form Block or Die

The wooden block or lead die designed for form block 
bumping must have the same dimensions and contour as the 
outside of the blister. To provide enough bucking weight 
and bearing surface for fastening the metal, the block or die 
should be at least one inch larger in all dimensions than the 
form requires.

Follow these procedures to create a form block: 

1. Hollow the block out with tools, such as saws, chisels, 
gouges, files, and rasps.

2. Smooth and finish the block with sandpaper. The inside 
of the form must be as smooth as possible, because the 
slightest irregularity shows up on the finished part.

3. Prepare several templates (patterns of the cross-
section), as shown in Figure 4-161 so that the form 
can be checked for accuracy.

4. Shape the contour of the form at points 1, 2, and 3.

5. Shape the areas between the template checkpoints to 
conform the remaining contour to template 4. Shaping 
of the form block requires particular care because 
the more nearly accurate it is, the less time it takes to 
produce a smooth, finished part.

 
After the form is prepared and checked, perform the bumping 
as follows:

1. Cut a metal blank to size allowing an extra 1⁄2 to 1-inch 
to permit drawing.

2. Apply a thin coat of light oil to the block and the 
aluminum to prevent galling (scraping on rough spots).

3. Clamp the material between the block and steel plate. 
Ensure it is firmly supported yet it can slip a little 
toward the inside of the form.

4. Clamp the bumping block in a bench vise. Use a soft-
faced rubber mallet, or a hardwood drive block with 
a suitable mallet, to start the bumping near the edges 
of the form.

5. Work the material down gradually from the edges 
with light blows of the mallet. Remember, the purpose 
of bumping is to work the material into shape by 
stretching rather than forcing it into the form with 
heavy blows. Always start bumping near the edge of 
the form. Never start near the center of the blister.

6. Before removing the work from the form, smooth it 
as much as possible by rubbing it with the rounded 
end of either a maple block or a stretching mallet.

7. Remove the blister from the bumping block and trim 
to size.

Figure 4-162. Sandbag bumping. 

Sandbag Bumping 

Sandbag bumping is one of the most difficult methods of 
hand forming sheet metal because there is no exact forming 
block to guide the operation. [Figure 4-162] In this method, 
a depression is made into the sandbag to take the shape of 
the hammered portion of the metal. The depression or pit has 
a tendency to shift from the hammering, which necessitates 
periodic readjustment during the bumping process. The 
degree of shifting depends largely on the contour or shape 
of the piece being formed, and whether glancing blows must 
be struck to stretch, draw, or shrink the metal. When forming 
by this method, prepare a contour template or some sort of 
a pattern to serve as a working guide and to ensure accuracy 
of the finished part. Make the pattern from ordinary kraft or 
similar paper, folding it over the part to be duplicated. Cut the 
paper cover at the points where it would have to be stretched 
to fit, and attach additional pieces of paper with masking tape 
to cover the exposed portions. After completely covering the 
part, trim the pattern to exact size.

Open the pattern and spread it out on the metal from which 
the part is to be formed. Although the pattern does not lie flat, 
it gives a fairly accurate idea of the approximate shape of the 
metal to be cut, and the pieced-in sections indicate where the 
metal is to be stretched. When the pattern has been placed on 
the material, outline the part and the portions to be stretched 
using a felt-tipped pen. Add at least 1-inch of excess metal 
when cutting the material to size. Trim off the excess metal 
after bumping the part into shape.

If the part to be formed is radially symmetrical, it is fairly 
easy to shape since a simple contour template can be used as a 
working guide. The procedure for bumping sheet metal parts 
on a sandbag follows certain basic steps that can be applied 
to any part, regardless of its contour or shape.

1. Lay out and cut the contour template to serve as a 
working guide and to ensure accuracy of the finished 
part. (This can be made of sheet metal, medium to 
heavy cardboard, kraft paper, or thin plywood.)

2. Determine the amount of metal needed, lay it out, and 
cut it to size, allowing at least 1⁄2-inch in excess.

3. Place a sandbag on a solid foundation capable of 
supporting heavy blows and make a pit in the bag with 
a smooth-faced mallet. Analyze the part to determine 
the correct radius the pit should have for the forming 
operation. The pit changes shape with the hammering 
it receives and must be readjusted accordingly. 

4. Select a soft round-faced or bell-shaped mallet with 
a contour slightly smaller than the contour desired on 
the sheet metal part. Hold one edge of the metal in the 
left hand and place the portion to be bumped near the 
edge of the pit on the sandbag. Strike the metal with 
light glancing blows. 

5. Continue bumping toward the center, revolving the 
metal, and working gradually inward until the desired 
shape is obtained. Shape the entire part as a unit.

6. Check the part often for accuracy of shape during the 
bumping process by applying the template. If wrinkles 
form, work them out before they become too large.

7. Remove small dents and hammer marks with a suitable 
stake and planishing hammer or with a hand dolly and 
planishing hammer.

8. Finally, after bumping is completed, use a pair of 
dividers to mark around the outside of the object. Trim 
the edge and file it smooth. Clean and polish the part.

Joggling
A joggle, often found at the intersection of stringers and 
formers, is the offset formed on a part to allow clearance for 
a sheet or another mating part. Use of the joggle maintains 
the smooth surface of a joint or splice. The amount of 
offset is usually small; therefore, the depth of the joggle is 
generally specified in thousandths of an inch. The thickness 
of the material to be cleared governs the depth of the joggle. 
In determining the necessary length of the joggle, allow an 
extra 1⁄16-inch to give enough added clearance to assure a fit 
between the joggled, overlapped part. The distance between 
the two bends of a joggle is called the allowance. This 
dimension is normally called out on the drawing. However, 
a general rule of thumb for figuring allowance is four times 
the thickness of the displacement of flat sheets. For 90° 
angles, it must be slightly more due to the stress built up 
at the radius while joggling. For extrusions, the allowance 
can be as much as 12 times the material thickness, so, it is 
important to follow the drawing.

Figure 4-163. Forming joggle using joggle blocks.

Figure 4-164. Samples of joggled metal.

There are a number of different methods of forming 
joggles. For example, if the joggle is to be made 
on a straight flange or flat piece of metal, it can be 
formed on a cornice brake. To form the joggle, use the  
following procedure: 

1. Lay out the boundary lines of the joggle where the 
bends are to occur on the sheet.

2. Insert the sheet in the brake and bend the metal up 
approximately 20° to 30°. 

3. Release the brake and remove the part.

4. Turn the part over and clamp it in the brake at the 
second bend line.

5. Bend the part up until the correct height of the joggle 
is attained.

6. Remove the part from the brake and check the joggle 
for correct dimensions and clearance.

 
When a joggle is necessary on a curved part or a curved 
flange, forming blocks or dies made of hardwood, steel, 
or aluminum alloy may be used. The forming procedure 
consists of placing the part to be joggled between the two 
joggle blocks and squeezing them in a vice or some other 
suitable clamping device. After the joggle is formed, the 
joggle blocks are turned over in the vice and the bulge on 
the opposite flange is flattened with a wooden or rawhide 
mallet. [Figure 4-163]

Since hardwood is easily worked, dies made of hardwood are 
satisfactory when the die is to be used only a few times. If 
a number of similar joggles are to be produced, use steel or 
aluminum alloy dies. Dies of aluminum alloy are preferred 
since they are easier to fabricate than those of steel and wear 
about as long. These dies are sufficiently soft and resilient 
to permit forming aluminum alloy parts on them without 
marring, and nicks and scratches are easily removed from 
their surfaces.

When using joggling dies for the first time, test them for 
accuracy on a piece of waste stock to avoid the possibility 
of ruining already fabricated parts. [Figure 4-164] Always 
keep the surfaces of the blocks free from dirt, filings, and 
the like, so that the work is not marred. 

Lightning Holes
Lightning holes are cut in rib sections, fuselage frames, and 
other structural parts to decrease weight. To avoid weakening
the member by removal of the material, flanges are often 
pressed around the holes to strengthen the area from which 
the material was removed.

Figure 4-166. Drill size and speed for drilling Inconel.

Lightning holes should never be cut in any structural part 
unless authorized. The size of the lightning hole and the 
width of the flange formed around the hole are determined by 
design specifications. Margins of safety are considered in the 
specifications so that the weight of the part can be decreased 
and still retain the necessary strength. Lightning holes may 
be cut with a hole saw, a punch, or a fly cutter. The edges 
are filed smooth to prevent them from cracking or tearing.

Flanging Lightning Holes

Form the flange by using a flanging die, or hardwood or 
metal form blocks. Flanging dies consist of two matching 
parts: a female and a male die. For flanging soft metal, dies 
can be of hardwood, such as maple. For hard metal or for 
more permanent use, they should be made of steel. The pilot 
guide should be the same size as the hole to be flanged, 
and the shoulder should be the same width and angle as the 
desired flange.

When flanging lightning holes, place the material between 
the mating parts of the die and form it by hammering or 
squeezing the dies together in a vise or in an arbor press (a 
small hand operated press). The dies work more smoothly 
if they are coated with light machine oil. [Figure 4-165]

Working Stainless Steel
Corrosion-resistant-steel (CRES) sheet is used on some 
parts of the aircraft when high strength is required. CRES 
causes magnesium, aluminum, or cadmium to corrode when 
it touches these metals. To isolate CRES from magnesium 
and aluminum, apply a finish that gives protection between 
their mating surfaces. It is important to use a bend radius 
that is larger than the recommended minimum bend radius 
to prevent cracking of the material in the bend area. 

When working with stainless steel, make sure that the metal 
does not become unduly scratched or marred. Also, take special 
precautions when shearing, punching, or drilling this metal. It 
takes about twice as much pressure to shear or punch stainless 
steel as it does mild steel. Keep the shear or punch and die 

adjusted very closely. Too much clearance permits the metal 
to be drawn over the edge of the die and causes it to become 
work hardened, resulting in excessive strain on the machine. 
When drilling stainless steel, use an HSS drill bit ground to 
an included angle of 135°. Keep the drill speed about one-half 
that required for drilling mild steel, but never exceed 750 rpm. 
Keep a uniform pressure on the drill so the feed is constant at 
all times. Drill the material on a backing plate, such as cast iron, 
which is hard enough to permit the drill bit to cut completely 
through the stock without pushing the metal away from the drill 
point. Spot the drill bit before turning on the power and also 
make sure that pressure is exerted when the power is turned on.

Working Inconel® Alloys 625 and 718
Inconel® refers to a family of nickel-chromium-iron super 
alloys typically used in high-temperature applications. 
Corrosion resistance and the ability to stay strong in high 
temperatures led to the frequent use of these Inconel® alloys 
in aircraft powerplant structures. Inconel® alloys 625 and 718 
can be cold formed by standard procedures used for steel 
and stainless steel.

Normal drilling into Inconel® alloys can break drill bits 
sooner and cause damage to the edge of the hole when the 
drill bit goes through the metal. If a hand drill is used to 
drill Inconel® alloys 625 and 718, select a 135° cobalt drill 
bit. When hand drilling, push hard on the drill, but stay at 
a constant chip rate. For example, with a No. 30 hole, push 
the drill with approximately 50 pounds of force. Use the 
maximum drill rpm as illustrated in Figure 4-166. A cutting 
fluid is not necessary when hand drilling.

The following drilling procedures are recommended: 

• Drill pilot holes in loose repair parts with power feed 
equipment before preassembling them.

• Preassemble the repair parts and drill the pilot holes 
in the mating structure.

• Enlarge the pilot holes to their completed hole 
dimension.

When drilling Inconel®, autofeed-type drilling equipment 
is preferred.

Working Magnesium
Warning: Keep magnesium particles away from sources of 
ignition. Small particles of magnesium burn very easily. 
In sufficient concentration, these small particles can cause 
an explosion. If water touches molten magnesium, a steam 
explosion could occur. Extinguish magnesium fires with dry 
talc, calcium carbonate, sand, or graphite. Apply the powder 
on the burning metal to a depth of 1⁄2-inch or more. Do not 
use foam, water, carbon tetrachloride, or carbon dioxide. 
Magnesium alloys must not touch methyl alcohol.

Magnesium is the world’s lightest structural metal. Like 
many other metals, this silvery-white element is not used in 
its pure state for stressed application. Instead, magnesium 
is alloyed with certain other metals (aluminum, zinc, 
zirconium, manganese, thorium, and rare earth metals) to 
obtain the strong, lightweight alloys needed for structural 
uses. When alloyed with these other metals, magnesium, 
yields alloys with excellent properties and high strength-
to-weight ratios. Proper combination of these alloying 
constituents provide alloys suitable for sand, permanent 
mold and die castings, forging, extrusions, rolled sheet, and 
plate with good properties at room temperature, as well as at 
elevated temperatures. 

Lightweight is the best known characteristic of magnesium, 
an important factor in aircraft design. In comparison, 
aluminum weighs one and one half times more, iron and steel 
weigh four times more, and copper and nickel alloys weigh 
five times more. Magnesium alloys can be cut, drilled, and 
reamed with the same tools that are used on steel or brass, 
but the cutting edges of the tool must be sharp. Type B rivets 
(5056-F aluminum alloy) are used when riveting magnesium 
alloy parts. Magnesium parts are often repaired with clad 
2024-T3 aluminum alloy. 

While magnesium alloys can usually be fabricated by methods 
similar to those used on other metals, remember that many 
of the details of shop practice cannot be applied. Magnesium 
alloys are difficult to fabricate at room temperature; therefore, 
most operations must be performed at high temperatures. This 
requires preheating of the metal or dies, or both. Magnesium 
alloy sheets may be cut by blade shears, blanking dies, 
routers, or saws. Hand or circular saws are usually used 
for cutting extrusions to length. Conventional shears and 
nibblers should never be used for cutting magnesium alloy 
sheet because they produce a rough, cracked edge. 

Shearing and blanking of magnesium alloys require close 
tool tolerances. A maximum clearance of 3 to 5 percent of 
the sheet thickness is recommended. The top blade of the 
shears should be ground with an included angle of 45° to 60º. 
The shear angle on a punch should be from 2° to 3°, with a 

1° clearance angle on the die. For blanking, the shear angle 
on the die should be from 2° to 3° with a 1° clearance angle 
on the punch. Hold-down pressures should be used when 
possible. Cold shearing should not be accomplished on a 
hard-rolled sheet thicker than 0.064-inch or annealed sheet 
thicker than 1⁄8-inch. Shaving is used to smooth the rough, 
flaky edges of a magnesium sheet that has been sheared. 
This operation consists of removing approximately 1⁄32-inch 
by a second shearing. 

Hot shearing is sometimes used to obtain an improved 
sheared edge. This is necessary for heavy sheet and plate 
stock. Annealed sheet may be heated to 600 °F, but hard-
rolled sheet must be held under 400 °F, depending on the 
alloy used. Thermal expansion makes it necessary to allow for 
shrinkage after cooling, which entails adding a small amount 
of material to the cold metal dimensions before fabrication.

Sawing is the only method used in cutting plate stock more 
than 1⁄2-inch thick. Bandsaw raker-set blades of 4- to 6-tooth 
pitch are recommended for cutting plate stock or heavy 
extrusions. Small and medium extrusions are more easily 
cut on a circular cutoff saw having six teeth per inch. Sheet 
stock can be cut on handsaws having raker-set or straight-set 
teeth with an 8-tooth pitch. Bandsaws should be equipped 
with nonsparking blade guides to eliminate the danger of 
sparks igniting the magnesium alloy filings.

Cold working most magnesium alloys at room temperature 
is very limited, because they work harden rapidly and do not 
lend themselves to any severe cold forming. Some simple 
bending operations may be performed on sheet material, but 
the radius of bend must be at least 7 times the thickness of 
the sheet for soft material and 12 times the thickness of the 
sheet for hard material. A radius of 2 or 3 times the thickness 
of the sheet can be used if the material is heated for the 
forming operation.

Since wrought magnesium alloys tend to crack after they 
are cold-worked, the best results are obtained if the metal is 
heated to 450 °F before any forming operations are attempted. 
Parts formed at the lower temperature range are stronger 
because the higher temperature range has an annealing effect 
on the metal.

The disadvantages of hot working magnesium are:

1. Heating the dies and the material is expensive  
and troublesome. 

2. There are problems in lubricating and handling 
materials at these temperatures.


4-85

The advantages to hot working magnesium are:

1. It is more easily formed when hot than are other 
metals.

2. Spring-back is reduced, resulting in greater dimensional 
accuracy.

When heating magnesium and its alloys, watch the 
temperature carefully as the metal is easily burned. 
Overheating also causes small molten pools to form within 
the metal. In either case, the metal is ruined. To prevent 
burning, magnesium must be protected with a sulfur dioxide 
atmosphere while being heated.

Proper bending around a short radius requires the removal of 
sharp corners and burrs near the bend line. Layouts should 
be made with a carpenter’s soft pencil because any marring 
of the surface may result in fatigue cracks.

Press brakes can be used for making bends with short radii. 
Die and rubber methods should be used where bends are 
to be made at right angles, which complicate the use of a 
brake. Roll forming may be accomplished cold on equipment 
designed for forming aluminum. The most common method 
of forming and shallow drawing of magnesium is to use a 
rubber pad as the female die. This rubber pad is held in an 
inverted steel pan that is lowered by a hydraulic press ram. 
The press exerts pressure on the metal and bends it to the 
shape of the male die.

The machining characteristics of magnesium alloys are 
excellent, making possible the use of maximum speeds of 
the machine tools with heavy cuts and high feed rates. Power 
requirements for machining magnesium alloys are about 
one-sixth of those for mild steel.

Filings, shavings, and chips from machining operations 
should be kept in covered metal containers because of the 
danger of combustion. Do not use magnesium alloys in 
liquid deicing and water injection systems or in the integral 
fuel tank areas.

Working Titanium
Keep titanium particles away from sources of ignition. 
Small particles of titanium burn very easily. In sufficient 
concentration, these small particles can cause an explosion. 
If water touches molten titanium, a steam explosion could 
occur. Extinguish titanium fires with dry talc, calcium 
carbonate, sand, or graphite. Apply the powder on the burning 
metal to a depth of 1⁄2-inch or more. Do not use foam, water, 
carbon tetrachloride, or carbon dioxide.

Description of Titanium
Titanium in its mineral state, is the fourth most abundant 
structural metal in the earth’s crust. It is lightweight, 
nonmagnetic, strong, corrosion resistant, and ductile. 
Titanium lies between the aluminum alloys and stainless 
steel in modulus, density, and strength at intermediate 
temperatures. Titanium is 30 percent stronger than steel, 
but is nearly 50 percent lighter. It is 60 percent heavier than 
aluminum, but twice as strong.

Titanium and its alloys are used chiefly for parts that require 
good corrosion resistance, moderate strength up to 600 °F 
(315 °C), and lightweight. Commercially pure titanium 
sheet may be formed by hydropress, stretch press, brake 
roll forming, drop hammer, or other similar operations. It is 
more difficult to form than annealed stainless steel. Titanium 
can also be worked by grinding, drilling, sawing, and the 
types of working used on other metals. Titanium must be 
isolated from magnesium, aluminum, or alloy steel because 
galvanic corrosion or oxidation of the other metals occurs 
upon contact.

Monel® rivets or standard close-tolerance steel fasteners 
should be used when installing titanium parts. The alloy 
sheet can be formed, to a limited extent, at room temperature. 
The forming of titanium alloys is divided into three classes:

• Cold forming with no stress relief

• Cold forming with stress relief

• Elevated temperature forming (built-in stress relief)

Over 5 percent of all titanium in the United States is produced 
in the form of the alloy Ti 6Al-4V, which is known as the 
workhorse of the titanium industry. Used in aircraft turbine 
engine components and aircraft structural components, Ti 
6Al-4V is approximately 3 times stronger than pure titanium. 
The most widely used titanium alloy, it is hard to form. 

The following are procedures for cold forming titanium 6Al-
4V annealed with stress relief (room temperature forming):

1. It is important to use a minimum radius chart when 
forming titanium because an excessively small radius 
introduces excess stress to the bend area.

2. Stress relieves the part as follows: heat the part to 
a temperature above 1,250 °F (677 °C), but below 
1,450 °F (788 °C). Keep the part at this temperature 
for more than 30 minutes but less than 10 hours.

3. A powerful press brake is required to form titanium 
parts. Regular hand-operated box and pan brakes 
cannot form titanium sheet material.

needs to be curved to fit the contour of the aircraft. 

Titanium can be difficult to drill, but standard high-speed 
drill bits may be used if the bits are sharp, if sufficient force 
is applied, and if a low-speed drill motor is used. If the drill 
bit is dull, or if it is allowed to ride in a partially drilled hole, 
an overheated condition is created, making further drilling 
extremely difficult. Therefore, keep holes as shallow as 
possible; use short, sharp drill bits of approved design; and 
flood the area with large amounts of cutting fluid to facilitate 
drilling or reaming. 

When working titanium, it is recommended that you 
use carbide or 8 percent cobalt drill bits, reamers, and 
countersinks. Ensure the drill or reamer is rotating to prevent 
scoring the side of the hole when removing either of them 
from a hole. Use a hand drill only when positive-power-feed 
drills are not available. 

The following guidelines are used for drilling titanium:

• The largest diameter hole that can be drilled in a single 
step is 0.1563-inch because a large force is required. 
Larger diameter drill bits do not cut satisfactorily 
when much force is used. Drill bits that do not cut 
satisfactorily cause damage to the hole.

• Holes with a diameter of 0.1875-inch and larger can 
be hand drilled if the operator:

- Starts with a hole with a diameter of 0.1563-inch.

- Increases the diameter of the hole in 0.0313-inch 
or 0.0625-inch increments.

• Cobalt vanadium drill bits last much longer than HSS 
bits.

• The recommended drill motor rpm settings for hand 
drilling titanium are listed in Figure 4-167.

• The life of a drill bit is shorter when drilling titanium 
than when drilling steel. Do not use a blunt drill bit 
or let a drill bit rub the surface of the metal and not 
cut it. If one of these conditions occurs, the titanium 
surface becomes work hardened, and it is very difficult 
to start the drill again.

• When hand drilling two or more titanium parts at the 
same time, clamp them together tightly. To clamp 

them together, use temporary bolts, Cleco clamps, or 
tooling clamps. Put the clamps around the area to drill 
and as near the area as possible.

• When hand drilling thin or flexible parts, put a support 
(such as a block of wood) behind the part. 

• Titanium has a low thermal conductivity. When it 
becomes hot, other metals become easily attached to 
it. Particles of titanium often become welded to the 
sharp edges of the drill bit if the drill speed is too high. 
When drilling large plates or extrusions, use a water 
soluble coolant or sulphurized oil.

NOTE: The intimate metal-to-metal contact in the metal 
working process creates heat and friction that must be 
reduced or the tools and the sheet metal used in the process 
are quickly damaged and/or destroyed. Coolants, also called 
cutting fluids, are used to reduce the friction at the interface 
of the tool and sheet metal by transferring heat away from the 
tool and sheet metal. Thus, the use of cutting fluids increases 
productivity, extends tool life, and results in a higher quality 
of workmanship.

Basic Principles of Sheet Metal Repair
Aircraft structural members are designed to perform a 
specific function or to serve a definite purpose. The primary 
objective of aircraft repair is to restore damaged parts to their 
original condition. Very often, replacement is the only way 
this can be done effectively. When repair of a damaged part 
is possible, first study the part carefully to fully understand 
its purpose or function.

Strength may be the principal requirement in the repair of 
certain structures, while others may need entirely different 
qualities. For example, fuel tanks and floats must be protected 
against leakage; cowlings, fairings, and similar parts must 
have such properties as neat appearance, streamlined 
shape, and accessibility. The function of any damaged part 
must be carefully determined to ensure the repair meets 
the requirements.

An inspection of the damage and accurate estimate of the type 
of repair required are the most important steps in repairing 
structural damage. The inspection includes an estimate of the 
best type and shape of repair patch to use; the type, size, and 
number of rivets needed; and the strength, thickness, and kind 
of material required to make the repaired member no heavier 
(or only slightly heavier) and just as strong as the original. 

When investigating damage to an aircraft, it is necessary to 
make an extensive inspection of the structure. When any 
component or group of components has been damaged, it is 
essential that both the damaged members and the attaching 


4-87

structure be investigated, since the damaging force may have 
been transmitted over a large area, sometimes quite remote 
from the point of original damage. Wrinkled skin, elongated 
or damaged bolt or rivet holes, or distortion of members 
usually appears in the immediate area of such damage, and 
any one of these conditions calls for a close inspection of 
the adjacent area. Check all skin, dents, and wrinkles for any 
cracks or abrasions. 

Nondestructive inspection methods (NDI) are used as 
required when inspecting damage. NDI methods serve as 
tools of prevention that allow defects to be detected before 
they develop into serious or hazardous failures. A trained 
and experienced technician can detect flaws or defects with 
a high degree of accuracy and reliability. Some of the defects 
found by NDI include corrosion, pitting, heat/stress cracks, 
and discontinuity of metals.

When investigating damage, proceed as follows:

• Remove all dirt, grease, and paint from the damaged 
and surrounding areas to determine the exact condition 
of each rivet, bolt, and weld.

• Inspect skin for wrinkles throughout a large area.

• Check the operation of all movable parts in the area.

• Determine if repair would be the best procedure.

In any aircraft sheet metal repair, it is critical to:

• Maintain original strength,

• Maintain original contour, and

• Minimize weight.

Maintaining Original Strength
Certain fundamental rules must be observed if the original 
strength of the structure is to be maintained.

Ensure that the cross-sectional area of a splice or patch is 
at least equal to or greater than that of the damaged part. 
Avoid abrupt changes in cross-sectional area. Eliminate 
dangerous stress concentration by tapering splices. To 
reduce the possibility of cracks starting from the corners of 
cutouts, try to make cutouts either circular or oval in shape. 
Where it is necessary to use a rectangular cutout, make the 
radius of curvature at each corner no smaller than 1⁄2-inch. If 
the member is subjected to compression or bending loads, 
the patch should be placed on the outside of the member to 
obtain a higher resistance to such loads. If the patch cannot 
be placed there, material one gauge thicker than the original 
shall be used for the repair. 

Replace buckled or bent members or reinforce them by 
attaching a splice over the affected area. A buckled part of the 
structure shall not be depended upon to carry its load again, 
no matter how well the part may be strengthened. 

The material used in all replacements or reinforcements must 
be similar to that used in the original structure. If an alloy 
weaker than the original must be substituted for it, a heavier 
thickness must be used to give equivalent cross-sectional 
strength. A material that is stronger, but thinner, cannot be 
substituted for the original because one material can have 
greater tensile strength but less compressive strength than 
another, or vice versa. Also, the buckling and torsional strength 
of many sheet metal and tubular parts depends primarily on the 
thickness of the material rather than its allowable compressive 
and shear strengths. The manufacturer’s SRM often indicates 
what material can be used as a substitution and how much 
thicker the material needs to be. Figure 4-168 is an example 
of a substitution table found in an SRM. 

Care must be taken when forming. Heat-treated and cold-
worked aluminum alloys stand very little bending without 
cracking. On the other hand, soft alloys are easily formed, 
but they are not strong enough for primary structure. Strong 
alloys can be formed in their annealed (heated and allowed 
to cool slowly) condition, and heat treated before assembling 
to develop their strength.

The size of rivets for any repair can be determined by 
referring to the rivets used by the manufacturer in the next 
parallel rivet row inboard on the wing or forward on the 
fuselage. Another method of determining the size of rivets to 
be used is to multiply the thickness of the skin by three and 
use the next larger size rivet corresponding to that figure. For 
example, if the skin thickness is 0.040-inch, multiply 0.040-
inch by 3, which equals 0.120-inch; use the next larger size 

rivet, 1⁄8-inch (0.125-inch). The number of rivets to be used 
for a repair can be found in tables in manufacturer’s SRMs or 
in Advisory Circular (AC) 43.13-1 (as revised), Acceptable 
Methods, Techniques, and Practices—Aircraft Inspection 
and Repair. Figure 4-169 is a table from AC 43.13-1 that is 
used to calculate the number of rivets required for a repair. 

Extensive repairs that are made too strong can be as 
undesirable as repairs weaker than the original structure. All 
aircraft structure must flex slightly to withstand the forces 
imposed during takeoff, flight, and landing. If a repaired 
area is too strong, excessive flexing occurs at the edge of 
the completed repair, causing acceleration of metal fatigue.

Notes
• All dimensions are in inches, unless given differently.

• It is possible that more protection from corrosion 
 will be necessary when bare mineral is used to 
 replace Clad material. Refer to 51-10-2.

• It is possible for the material replacement factor 
 to be a lower value for a specific location on the 
 airplane. To get that value, contact Boeing for a 
 case by case analysis.

• Refer to Figure 3 for minimun bend radii.

• Example:
      To refer 0.040 thick 7075–T6 with Clad 7075–T6, 
      multiply the gage by the material replacement factor 
      to get the replacement gage 0. 040 x 1.10 = 0.045. 

These materials cannot be used as replacements for the 
initial material in areas that are pressured.

They also cannot be used in the wing interspar structure at 
the wing center section structure. 

Use the next thicker standard gage when you use a formed 
section as a replacement for an extrusion.

For all gages of flat sheet and formed sections.

For flat sheet less than 0.071 thick.

For flat sheet 0.071 thick and thicker, and for formed sections.

2024–T4 and 2024–T42 are equivalent.

A compound to give protection from corrosion must be 
applied to bare material that is used to replace 5052–H34.

Shear Strength and Bearing Strength
Aircraft structural joint design involves an attempt to find 
the optimum strength relationship between being critical in 
shear and critical in bearing. These are determined by the 
failure mode affecting the joint. The joint is critical in shear 
if less than the optimum number of fasteners of a given size 

are installed. This means that the rivets will fail, and not 
the sheet, if the joint fails. The joint is critical in bearing if 
more than the optimum number of fasteners of a given size 
are installed; the material may crack and tear between holes, 
or fastener holes may distort and stretch while the fasteners 
remain intact.

Engineering Notes
 a. The load per inch of width of material was calculated by assuming a strip 1 inch wide in tension.
 b. Number of rivets required was calculated for 2117–T4 (AD) rivets, based on a rivet allowable shear stress equal to 
  percent of the sheet allowable tensile stress, and a sheet allowable bearing stress equal to 160 percent of the sheet 
  allowable tensile stress, using nominal hole diameters for rivets.
 c. Combinations of shoot thickness and rivet size above the underlined numbers are critical in (i.e., will fail by) bearing 
  on the sheet; those below are critical in shearing of the rivets.
 d. The number of AN–3 bolts required below the underlined number was calculated based on a sheet allowable tensile 
  stress of 55.000 psi and a bolt allowable single shear load of 2.126 pounds.

Maintaining Original Contour
Form all repairs in such a manner to fit the original contour 
perfectly. A smooth contour is especially desirable when 
making patches on the smooth external skin of high- 
speed aircraft.

Keeping Weight to a Minimum
Keep the weight of all repairs to a minimum. Make the size 
of the patches as small as practicable and use no more rivets 
than are necessary. In many cases, repairs disturb the original 
balance of the structure. The addition of excessive weight in 
each repair may unbalance the aircraft, requiring adjustment 
of the trim-and-balance tabs. In areas such as the spinner 
on the propeller, a repair requires application of balancing 
patches in order to maintain a perfect balance of the propeller. 
When flight controls are repaired and weight is added, it is 
very important to perform a balancing check to determine if 
the flight control is still within its balance limitations. Failure 
to do so could result in flight control flutter.

Flutter and Vibration Precautions
To prevent severe vibration or flutter of flight control surfaces 
during flight, precautions must be taken to stay within the 
design balance limitations when performing maintenance or 
repair. The importance of retaining the proper balance and 
rigidity of aircraft control surfaces cannot be overemphasized. 
The effect of repair or weight change on the balance and CG 
is proportionately greater on lighter surfaces than on the older 
heavier designs. As a general rule, repair the control surface 
in such a manner that the weight distribution is not affected 
in any way, in order to preclude the occurrence of flutter 
of the control surface in flight. Under certain conditions, 
counterbalance weight is added forward of the hinge line to 
maintain balance. Add or remove balance weights only when 
necessary in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Flight testing must be accomplished to ensure flutter is not a 
problem. Failure to check and retain control surface balance 
within the original or maximum allowable value could result 
in a serious flight hazard.

Aircraft manufacturers use different repair techniques and 
repairs designed and approved for one type of aircraft are 
not automatically approved for other types of aircraft. When 
repairing a damaged component or part, consult the applicable 
section of the manufacturer’s SRM for the aircraft. Usually 
the SRM contains an illustration for a similar repair along 
with a list of the types of material, rivets and rivet spacing, 
and the methods and procedures to be used. Any additional 
knowledge needed to make a repair is also detailed. If the 
necessary information is not found in the SRM, attempt to 
find a similar repair or assembly installed by the manufacturer 
of the aircraft.

Inspection of Damage 
When visually inspecting damage, remember that there may 
be other kinds of damage than that caused by impact from 
foreign objects or collision. A rough landing may overload one 
of the landing gear, causing it to become sprung; this would 
be classified as load damage. During inspection and sizing up 
of the repair job, consider how far the damage caused by the 
sprung shock strut extends to supporting structural members.

A shock occurring at one end of a member is transmitted 
throughout its length; therefore, closely inspect all rivets, 
bolts, and attaching structures along the complete member 
for any evidence of damage. Make a close examination for 
rivets that have partially failed and for holes that have been 
elongated.

Whether specific damage is suspected or not, an aircraft 
structure must occasionally be inspected for structural 
integrity. The following paragraphs provide general 
guidelines for this inspection.

When inspecting the structure of an aircraft, it is very 
important to watch for evidence of corrosion on the inside. 
This is most likely to occur in pockets and corners where 
moisture and salt spray may accumulate; therefore, drain 
holes must always be kept clean.

While an injury to the skin covering caused by impact with an 
object is plainly evident, a defect, such as distortion or failure 
of the substructure, may not be apparent until some evidence 
develops on the surface, such as canted, buckled or wrinkled 
covering, and loose rivets or working rivets. A working rivet 
is one that has movement under structural stress, but has not 
loosened to the extent that movement can be observed. This 
situation can sometimes be noted by a dark, greasy residue or 
deterioration of paint and primers around rivet heads. External 
indications of internal injury must be watched for and correctly 
interpreted. When found, an investigation of the substructure 
in the vicinity should be made and corrective action taken.

Warped wings are usually indicated by the presence of 
parallel skin wrinkles running diagonally across the wings 
and extending over a major area. This condition may develop 
from unusually violent maneuvers, extremely rough air, or 
extra hard landings. While there may be no actual rupture of 
any part of the structure, it may be distorted and weakened. 
Similar failures may also occur in fuselages. Small cracks in 
the skin covering may be caused by vibration and they are 
frequently found leading away from rivets.

Aluminum alloy surfaces having chipped protective coating, 
scratches, or worn spots that expose the surface of the metal 
should be recoated at once, as corrosion may develop rapidly. 
The same principle is applied to aluminum clad (Alclad™) 
surfaces. Scratches, which penetrate the pure aluminum 
surface layer, permit corrosion to take place in the alloy 
beneath.

A simple visual inspection cannot accurately determine if 
suspected cracks in major structural members actually exist 
or the full extent of the visible cracks. Eddy current and 
ultrasonic inspection techniques are used to find hidden 
damage.

Types of Damage and Defects
Types of damage and defects that may be observed on aircraft 
parts are defined as follows:

• Brinelling—occurrence of shallow, spherical 
depressions in a surface, usually produced by a part 
having a small radius in contact with the surface under 
high load.

• Burnishing—polishing of one surface by sliding 
contact with a smooth, harder surface. Usually there 
is no displacement or removal of metal.

• Burr—a small, thin section of metal extending beyond 
a regular surface, usually located at a corner or on the 
edge of a hole.

• Corrosion—loss of metal from the surface by chemical 
or electrochemical action. The corrosion products 
generally are easily removed by mechanical means. 
Iron rust is an example of corrosion.

• Crack—a physical separation of two adjacent portions 
of metal, evidenced by a fine or thin line across the 
surface caused by excessive stress at that point. It 
may extend inward from the surface from a few 
thousandths of an inch to completely through the 
section thickness.

• Cut—loss of metal, usually to an appreciable depth 
over a relatively long and narrow area, by mechanical

Crack

means, as would occur with the use of a saw blade, 
chisel, or sharp-edged stone striking a glancing blow.

• Dent—indentation in a metal surface produced by an 
object striking with force. The surface surrounding 
the indentation is usually slightly upset.

• Erosion—loss of metal from the surface by 
mechanical action of foreign objects, such as grit or 
fine sand. The eroded area is rough and may be lined 
in the direction in which the foreign material moved 
relative to the surface.

• Chattering—breakdown or deterioration of metal 
surface by vibratory or chattering action. Although 
chattering may give the general appearance of metal 
loss or surface cracking, usually, neither has occurred.

• Galling—breakdown (or build-up) of metal surfaces 
due to excessive friction between two parts having 
relative motion. Particles of the softer metal are torn 
loose and welded to the harder metal.

• Gouge—groove in, or breakdown of, a metal surface 
from contact with foreign material under heavy 
pressure. Usually it indicates metal loss but may be 
largely the displacement of material.

• Inclusion—presence of foreign or extraneous material 
wholly within a portion of metal. Such material is 
introduced during the manufacture of rod, bar or 
tubing by rolling or forging.

• Nick—local break or notch on an edge. Usually it 
involves the displacement of metal rather than loss.

• Pitting—sharp, localized breakdown (small, deep 
cavity) of metal surface, usually with defined edges.

• Scratch—slight tear or break in metal surface from 
light, momentary contact by foreign material.

• Score—deeper (than scratch) tear or break in metal 
surface from contact under pressure. May show 
discoloration from temperature produced by friction.

• Stain—a change in color, locally causing a noticeably 
different appearance from the surrounding area.

• Upsetting—a displacement of material beyond the 
normal contour or surface (a local bulge or bump). 
Usually it indicates no metal loss.

 
Classification of Damage
Damages may be grouped into four general classes. In many 
cases, the availabilities of repair materials and time are the 
most important factors in determining if a part should be 
repaired or replaced.

Negligible Damage
Negligible damage consists of visually apparent, surface 
damage that do not affect the structural integrity of the 
component involved. Negligible damage may be left as is or 
may be corrected by a simple procedure without restricting 
flight. In both cases, some corrective action must be taken to 
keep the damage from spreading. Negligible or minor damage 
areas must be inspected frequently to ensure the damage does 
not spread. Permissible limits for negligible damage vary 
for different components of different aircraft and should be 
carefully researched on an individual basis. Failure to ensure 
that damages within the specified limit of negligible damage 
may result in insufficient structural strength of the affected 
support member for critical flight conditions.

Small dents, scratches, cracks, and holes that can be repaired 
by smoothing, sanding, stop drilling, or hammering out, or 
otherwise repaired without the use of additional materials, 
fall in this classification. [Figure 4-170]

Damage Repairable by Patching
Damage repairable by patching is any damage exceeding 
negligible damage limits that can be repaired by installing 
splice members to bridge the damaged portion of a structural 
part. The splice members are designed to span the damaged 
areas and to overlap the existing undamaged surrounding 
structure. The splice or patch material used in internal riveted 
and bolted repairs is normally the same type of material as 
the damaged part, but one gauge heavier. In a patch repair, 
filler plates of the same gauge and type of material as that in 
the damaged component may be used for bearing purposes or 
to return the damaged part to its original contour. Structural 
fasteners are applied to members and the surrounding 
structure to restore the original load-carrying characteristics

Damage must be repaired by insertion when the area is too 
large to be patched or the structure is arranged such that repair 
members would interfere with structural alignment (e.g., in a 
hinge or bulkhead). In this type of repair, the damaged portion 
is removed from the structure and replaced by a member 
identical in material and shape. Splice connections at each 
end of the insertion member provide for load transfer to the 
original structure.

Damage Necessitating Replacement of Parts
Components must be replaced when their location or extent 
of damage makes repair impractical, when replacement is 
more economical than repair, or when the damaged part is 
relatively easy to replace. For example, replacing damaged 
castings, forgings, hinges, and small structural members, 
when available, is more practical than repairing them. Some 
highly stressed members must be replaced because repair 
would not restore an adequate margin of safety.

Repairability of Sheet Metal Structure
The following criteria can be used to help an aircraft technician 
decide upon the repairability of a sheet metal structure:

• Type of damage.

• Type of original material.

• Location of the damage.

• Type of repair required.

• Tools and equipment available to make the repair.

The following methods, procedures, and materials are only 
typical and should not be used as the authority for a repair.

Structural Support During Repair
During repair, the aircraft must be adequately supported to 
prevent further distortion or damage. It is also important that 
the structure adjacent to the repair is supported when it is 
subject to static loads. The aircraft structure can be supported 
adequately by the landing gear or by jacks where the work 
involves a repair, such as removing the control surfaces, 
wing panels, or stabilizers. Cradles must be prepared to hold 
these components while they are removed from the aircraft. 

When the work involves extensive repair of the fuselage, 
landing gear, or wing center section, a jig (a device for 
holding parts in position to maintain their shape) may be 
constructed to distribute the loads while repairs are being 
accomplished. Figure 4-171 shows a typical aircraft jig. 

Always check the applicable aircraft maintenance manual 
for specific support requirements.

Assessment of Damage
Before starting any repair, the extent of damage must be 
fully evaluated to determine if repair is authorized or even 
practical. This evaluation should identify the original material 
used and the type of repair required. The assessment of the 
damage begins with an inspection of riveted joints and an 
inspection for corrosion.

Inspection of Riveted Joints
Inspection consists of examining both the shop and 
manufactured heads and the surrounding skin and structural 
parts for deformities.

During the repair of an aircraft structural part, examine 
adjacent parts to determine the condition of neighboring 
rivets. The presence of chipped or cracked paint around 
the heads may indicate shifted or loose rivets. If the heads 
are tipped or if rivets are loose, they show up in groups of 
several consecutive rivets and are probably tipped in the same 
direction. If heads that appear to be tipped are not in groups 


4-93

Figure 4-172. Smoking rivet.

and are not tipped in the same direction, tipping may have 
occurred during some previous installation.

Inspect rivets that are known to have been critically loaded, 
but that show no visible distortion, by drilling off the head and 
carefully punching out the shank. If upon examination, the 
shank appears joggled and the holes in the sheet misaligned, 
the rivet has failed in shear. In that case, determine what 
is causing the stress and take necessary corrective action. 
Countersunk rivets that show head slippage within the 
countersink or dimple, indicating either sheet bearing failure 
or rivet shear failure, must be replaced.

Joggles in removed rivet shanks indicate partial shear failure. 
Replace these rivets with the next larger size. Also, if the 
rivet holes show elongation, replace the rivets with the next 
larger size. Sheet failures, such as tearouts, cracks between 
rivets, and the like, usually indicate damaged rivets, and the 
complete repair of the joint may require replacement of the 
rivets with the next larger size.

The presence of a black residue around the rivets is not an 
indication of looseness, but it is an indication of movement 
(fretting). The residue, which is aluminum oxide, is formed 
by a small amount of relative motion between the rivet and 
the adjacent surface. This is called fretting corrosion, or 
smoking, because the aluminum dust quickly forms a dark, 
dirty looking trail, like a smoke trail. Sometimes, the thinning 
of the moving pieces can propagate a crack. If a rivet is 
suspected of being defective, this residue may be removed 
with a general purpose abrasive hand pad, such as those 
manufactured by Scotch Brite™, and the surface inspected 
for signs of pitting or cracking. Although the condition 
indicates the component is under significant stress, it does 
not necessarily precipitate cracking. [Figure 4-172] 

Airframe cracking is not necessarily caused by defective 
rivets. It is common practice in the industry to size rivet 
patterns assuming one or more of the rivets is not effective. 
This means that a loose rivet would not necessarily overload 
adjacent rivets to the point of cracking.

Rivet head cracking are acceptable under the following 
conditions:

• The depth of the crack is less than 1⁄8 of the shank 
diameter.

• The width of the crack is less than 1⁄16 of the shank 
diameter.

• The length of the crack is confined to an area 
on the head within a circle having a maximum 
diameter of 11⁄4 times the shank diameter.

• Cracks should not intersect, which creates the 
potential for the loss of a portion of a head. 

Inspection for Corrosion
Corrosion is the gradual deterioration of metal due to a 
chemical or electrochemical reaction with its environment. 
The reaction can be triggered by the atmosphere, moisture, 
or other agents. When inspecting the structure of an aircraft, 
it is important to watch for evidence of corrosion on both the 
outside and inside. Corrosion on the inside is most likely to 
occur in pockets and corners where moisture and salt spray 
may accumulate; therefore, drain holes must always be kept 
clean. Also inspect the surrounding members for evidence 
of corrosion. 

Damage Removal
To prepare a damaged area for repair: 

1. Remove all distorted skin and structure in 
damaged area.

2. Remove damaged material so that the edges of the 
completed repair match existing structure and aircraft 
lines.

3. Round all square corners.

4. Smooth out any abrasions and/or dents.

5. Remove and incorporate into the new repair any 
previous repairs joining the area of the new repair.

Repair Material Selection
The repair material must duplicate the strength of the original 
structure. If an alloy weaker than the original material has 
to be used, a heavier gauge must be used to give equivalent 
cross-sectional strength. A lighter gauge material should not 
be used even when using a stronger alloy.

Repair Parts Layout 
All new sections fabricated for repairing or replacing 
damaged parts in a given aircraft should be carefully laid 
out to the dimensions listed in the applicable aircraft manual 
before fitting the parts into the structure.


4-94

Rivet Selection 
Normally, the rivet size and material should be the same as 
the original rivets in the part being repaired. If a rivet hole has 
been enlarged or deformed, the next larger size rivet must be 
used after reworking the hole. When this is done, the proper 
edge distance for the larger rivet must be maintained. Where 
access to the inside of the structure is impossible and blind 
rivets must be used in making the repair, always consult the 
applicable aircraft maintenance manual for the recommended 
type, size, spacing, and number of rivets needed to replace 
either the original installed rivets or those that are required 
for the type of repair being performed.

Rivet Spacing and Edge Distance
The rivet pattern for a repair must conform to instructions 
in the applicable aircraft manual. The existing rivet pattern 
is used whenever possible.

Corrosion Treatment 
Prior to assembly of repair or replacement parts, make certain 
that all existing corrosion has been removed in the area and 
that the parts are properly insulated one from the other.

Approval of Repair
Once the need for an aircraft repair has been established, Title 
14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) defines the 
approval process. 14 CFR part 43, section 43.13(a) states that 
each person performing maintenance, alteration, or preventive 
maintenance on an aircraft, engine, propeller, or appliance 
shall use the methods, techniques, and practices prescribed in 
the current manufacturer’s maintenance manual or instructions 
for continued airworthiness prepared by its manufacturer, or 
other methods, techniques, or practices acceptable to the  
Administrator. AC 43.13-1 contains methods, techniques, and 
practices acceptable to the Administrator for the inspection 
and repair of nonpressurized areas of civil aircraft, only when 
there are no manufacturer repair or maintenance instructions. 
This data generally pertains to minor repairs. The repairs 
identified in this AC may only be used as a basis for FAA 
approval for major repairs. The repair data may also be used 
as approved data, and the AC chapter, page, and paragraph 
listed in block 8 of FAA Form 337 when:

a.  The user has determined that it is appropriate to the 
product being repaired;

b.  It is directly applicable to the repair being made; and

c.  It is not contrary to manufacturer’s data.

Engineering support from the aircraft manufacturer is 
required for repair techniques and methods that are not 
described in the aircraft maintenance manual or SRM. 

FAA Form 337, Major Repair and Alteration, must be 
completed for repairs to the following parts of an airframe and 
repairs of the following types involving the strengthening, 
reinforcing, splicing, and manufacturing of primary structural 
members or their replacement, when replacement is by 
fabrication, such as riveting or welding. [Figure 4-173]

For major repairs made in accordance with a manual or 
specifications acceptable to the Administrator, a certificated 
repair station may use the customer’s work order upon which 
the repair is recorded in place of the FAA Form 337.

Repair of Stressed Skin Structure 
In aircraft construction, stressed skin is a form of construction 
in which the external covering (skin) of an aircraft carries 
part or all of the main loads. Stressed skin is made from high 
strength rolled aluminum sheets. Stressed skin carries a large 
portion of the load imposed upon an aircraft structure. Various 
specific skin areas are classified as highly critical, semicritical,

or noncritical. To determine specific repair requirements for 
these areas, refer to the applicable aircraft maintenance manual. 

Minor damage to the outside skin of the aircraft can be 
repaired by applying a patch to the inside of the damaged 
sheet. A filler plug must be installed in the hole made by 
the removal of the damaged skin area. It plugs the hole and 
forms a smooth outside surface necessary for aerodynamic 
smoothness of the aircraft. The size and shape of the patch 
is determined in general by the number of rivets required in 
the repair. If not otherwise specified, calculate the required 
number of rivets by using the rivet formula. Make the patch 
plate of the same material as the original skin and of the same 
thickness or of the next greater thickness.

Patches 
Skin patches may be classified as two types:

• Lap or scab patch

• Flush patch

Lap or Scab Patch

The lap or scab type of patch is an external patch where 
the edges of the patch and the skin overlap each other. The 
overlapping portion of the patch is riveted to the skin. Lap 
patches may be used in most areas where aerodynamic 
smoothness is not important. Figure 4-174 shows a typical 
patch for a crack and or for a hole.

When repairing cracks or small holes with a lap or scab patch, 
the damage must be cleaned and smoothed. In repairing 
cracks, a small hole must be drilled in each end and sharp 
bend of the crack before applying the patch. These holes 
relieve the stress at these points and prevent the crack from 
spreading. The patch must be large enough to install the 
required number of rivets. It may be cut circular, square, 
or rectangular. If it is cut square or rectangular, the corners 
are rounded to a radius no smaller than 1⁄4-inch. The edges 
must be chamfered to an angle of 45° for 1⁄2 the thickness 
of the material, and bent down 5° over the edge distance 
to seal the edges. This reduces the chance that the repair is 
affected by the airflow over it. These dimensions are shown 
in Figure 4-175.

Flush Patch

A flush patch is a filler patch that is flush to the skin when 
applied it is supported by and riveted to a reinforcement 
plate which is, in turn, riveted to the inside of the skin. 
Figure 4-176 shows a typical flush patch repair. The doubler 
is inserted through the opening and rotated until it slides in 
place under the skin. The filler must be of the same gauge 
and material as the original skin. The doubler should be of 
material one gauge heavier than the skin.

Open and Closed Skin Area Repair 

The factors that determine the methods to be used in 
skin repair are accessibility to the damaged area and the 
instructions found in the aircraft maintenance manual. The 
skin on most areas of an aircraft is inaccessible for making 
the repair from the inside and is known as closed skin. Skin 
that is accessible from both sides is called open skin.

Figure 4-176. Typical flush patch repair. 

Figure 4-177. Repair patch for a non-pressurized area.

Usually, repairs to open skin can be made in the conventional 
manner using standard rivets, but in repairing closed skin, 
some type of special fastener must be used. The exact type 
to be used depends on the type of repair being made and the 
recommendations of the aircraft manufacturer.

Design of a Patch for a Non-pressurized Area

Damage to the aircraft skin in a non-pressurized area 
can be repaired by a flush patch if a smooth skin surface 
is required or by an external patch in noncritical areas. 
[Figure 4-177] The first step is to remove the damage. Cut 

the damage to a round, oval, or rectangular shape. Round 
all corners of a rectangular patch to a minimum radius of 
0.5-inch. The minimum edge distance used is 2 times the 
diameter and the rivet spacing is typically between 4-6 times 
the diameter. The size of the doubler depends on the edge 
distance and rivet spacing. The doubler material is of the same 
material as the damaged skin, but of one thickness greater 
than the damaged skin. The size of the doubler depends on 
the edge distance and rivet spacing. The insert is made of 
the same material and thickness as the damaged skin. The 
size and type of rivets should be the same as rivets used for 
similar joints on the aircraft. The SRM indicates what size 
and type of rivets to use.

Typical Repairs for Aircraft Structures 
This section describes typical repairs of the major structural 
parts of an airplane. When repairing a damaged component 
or part, consult the applicable section of the manufacturer’s 


4-99

SRM for the aircraft. Normally, a similar repair is illustrated, 
and the types of material, rivets, and rivet spacing and the 
methods and procedures to be used are listed. Any additional 
knowledge needed to make a repair is also detailed. If the 
necessary information is not found in the SRM, attempt to 
find a similar repair or assembly installed by the manufacturer 
of the aircraft.

Floats
To maintain the float in an airworthy condition, periodic and 
frequent inspections should be made because of the rapidity 
of corrosion on metal parts, particularly when the aircraft is 
operated in salt water. Inspection of floats and hulls involves 
examination for damage due to corrosion, collision with 
other objects, hard landings, and other conditions that may 
lead to failure. 

NOTE: Blind rivets should not be used on floats or amphibian 
hulls below the water line.

Sheet-metal floats should be repaired using approved 
practices; however, the seams between sections of sheet 
metal should be waterproofed with suitable fabric and sealing 
compound. A float that has undergone hull repairs should be 
tested by filling it with water and allowing it to stand for at 
least 24 hours to see if any leaks develop. [Figure 4-178]

Corrugated Skin Repair
Some of the flight controls of smaller general aviation aircraft 
have beads in their skin panels. The beads give some stiffness 
to the thin skin panels. The beads for the repair patch can be 
formed with a rotary former or press brake. [Figure 4-179]

Replacement of a Panel
Damage to metal aircraft skin that exceeds repairable limits 
requires replacement of the entire panel. [Figure 4-180] A 
panel must also be replaced when there are too many previous 
repairs in a given section or area.

In aircraft construction, a panel is any single sheet of metal 
covering. A panel section is the part of a panel between 
adjacent stringers and bulk heads. Where a section of skin 
is damaged to such an extent that it is impossible to install 
a standard skin repair, a special type of repair is necessary. 
The particular type of repair required depends on whether the 
damage is repairable outside the member, inside the member, 
or to the edges of the panel.

Outside the Member 
For damage that, after being trimmed, has 81⁄2 rivet diameters or 
more of material, extend the patch to include the manufacturer’s 
row of rivets and add an extra row inside the members.

Inside the Member
For damage that, after being trimmed, has less than 81⁄2 
manufacturer’s rivet diameters of material inside the 
members, use a patch that extends over the members and an 
extra row of rivets along the outside of the members. 

Edges of the Panel 
For damage that extends to the edge of a panel, use 
only one row of rivets along the panel edge, unless the 
manufacturer used more than one row. The repair procedure 
for the other edges of the damage follows the previously 
explained methods.

The procedures for making all three types of panel repairs 
are similar. Trim out the damaged portion to the allowances 
mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. For relief of stresses 
at the corners of the trim-out, round them to a minimum 
radius of ½-inch. Lay out the new rivet row with a transverse 
pitch of approximately five rivet diameters and stagger the 
rivets with those put in by the manufacturer. Cut the patch 
plate from material of the same thickness as the original or 
the next greater thickness, allowing an edge distance of 21⁄2 
rivet diameters. At the corners, strike arcs having the radius 
equal to the edge distance. 

Chamfer the edges of the patch plate for a 45° angle and form 
the plate to fit the contour of the original structure. Turn the 
edges downward slightly so that the edges fit closely. Place 
the patch plate in its correct position, drill one rivet hole, and 
temporarily fasten the plate in place with a fastener. Using a 
hole finder, locate the position of a second hole, drill it, and 
insert a second fastener. Then, from the back side and through 
the original holes, locate and drill the remaining holes. 
Remove the burrs from the rivet holes and apply corrosion 
protective material to the contacting surfaces before riveting 
the patch into place.

Repair of Lightning Holes
As discussed earlier, lightning holes are cut in rib sections, 
fuselage frames, and other structural parts to reduce the 
weight of the part. The holes are flanged to make the web 
stiffer. Cracks can develop around flanged lightning holes, 
and these cracks need to be repaired with a repair plate. 
The damaged area (crack) needs to be stop drilled or the 
damage must be removed. The repair plate is made of the 
same material and thickness as the damaged part. Rivets are 
the same as in surrounding structure and the minimum edge 
distance is 2 times the diameter and spacing is between four 
to six times the diameter. Figure 4-181 illustrates a typical 
lightning hole repair.

Repairs to a Pressurized Area
The skin of aircraft that are pressurized during flight is highly 
stressed. The pressurization cycles apply loads to the skin, 
and the repairs to this type of structure requires more rivets 
than a repair to a nonpressurized skin. [Figure 4-182]

2. Radius all corners to 0.5-inch.

3. Fabricate a doubler of the same type of material as,

size of the doubler depends on the number of rows, 
edge distance, and rivets spacing.

4. Fabricate an insert of the same material and same 
thickness as the damaged skin. The skin to insert 
clearance is typically 0.015-inch to 0.035-inch.

5. Drill the holes through the doubler, insertion, and 
original skin.

6. Spread a thin layer of sealant on the doubler and secure 
the doubler to the skin with Clecos.

7. Use the same type of fastener as in the surrounding 
area, and install the doubler to the skin and the 
insertion to the doubler. Dip all fasteners in the sealant 
before installation.

Stringer Repair
The fuselage stringers extend from the nose of the aircraft 
to the tail, and the wing stringers extend from the fuselage 
to the wing tip. Surface control stringers usually extend the
length of the control surface. The skin of the fuselage, wing, 
or control surface is riveted to stringers. 

Stringers may be damaged by vibration, corrosion, or 
collision. Because stringers are made in many different 
shapes, repair procedures differ. The repair may require the 
use of preformed or extruded repair material, or it may require 
material formed by the airframe technician. Some repairs may 
need both kinds of repair material. When repairing a stringer, 
first determine the extent of the damage and remove the rivets 
from the surrounding area. [Figure 4-183] Then, remove the 
damaged area by using a hacksaw, keyhole saw, drill, or file. 
In most cases, a stringer repair requires the use of insert and 
splice angle. When locating the splice angle on the stringer 
during repair, be sure to consult the applicable structural 
repair manual for the repair piece’s position. Some stringers 
are repaired by placing the splice angle on the inside, whereas 
others are repaired by placing it on the outside.

Extrusions and preformed materials are commonly used to 
repair angles and insertions or fillers. If repair angles and 
fillers must be formed from flat sheet stock, use the brake. 
It may be necessary to use bend allowance and sight lines 
when making the layout and bends for these formed parts. 
For repairs to curved stringers, make the repair parts so that 
they fit the original contour.

Figure 4-184 shows a stringer repair by patching. This repair 
is permissible when the damage does not exceed two-thirds 
of the width of one leg and is not more than 12 inches long. 
Damage exceeding these limits can be repaired by one of the 
following methods.

Figure 4-185 illustrates repair by insertion where damage 
exceeds two-thirds of the width of one leg and after a portion 
of the stringer is removed. Figure 4-186 shows repair by 
insertion when the damage affects only one stringer and 
exceeds 12 inches in length. Figure 4-187 illustrates repair 
by an insertion when damage affects more than one stringer.

Former or Bulkhead Repair
Bulkheads are the oval-shaped members of the fuselage 
that give form to and maintain the shape of the structure. 
Bulkheads or formers are often called forming rings, 
body frames, circumferential rings, belt frames, and other 
similar names. They are designed to carry concentrated 
stressed loads.

There are various types of bulkheads. The most common type 
is a curved channel formed from sheet stock with stiffeners 
added. Others have a web made from sheet stock with 
extruded angles riveted in place as stiffeners and flanges. 
Most of these members are made from aluminum alloy. 
Corrosion-resistant steel formers are used in areas that are 
exposed to high temperatures.

Bulkhead damages are classified in the same manner as 
other damages. Specifications for each type of damage are 
established by the manufacturer and specific information is 

given in the maintenance manual or SRM for the aircraft. 
Bulkheads are identified with station numbers that are very 
helpful in locating repair information. Figure 4-188 is an 
example of a typical repair for a former, frame section, or 
bulkhead repair.

1. Stop drill the crack ends with a No. 40 size drill.

2. Fabricate a doubler of the same material but one size 
thicker than the part being repaired. The doubler 
should be of a size large enough to accommodate 1⁄8-
inch rivet holes spaced one inch apart, with a minimum 
edge distance of 0.30-inch and 0.50-inch spacing 
between staggered rows. [Figure 4-189]

3. Attach the doubler to the part with clamps and 
drill holes.

4. Install rivets.

Most repairs to bulkheads are made from flat sheet stock if 
spare parts are not available. When fabricating the repair from 
flat sheet, remember the substitute material must provide 
cross-sectional tensile, compressive, shear, and bearing 
strength equal to the original material. Never substitute 
material that is thinner or has a cross-sectional area less than 
the original material. Curved repair parts made from flat sheet 
must be in the “0” condition before forming, and then must 
be heat treated before installation.

Longeron Repair
Generally, longerons are comparatively heavy members 
that serve approximately the same function as stringers. 
Consequently, longeron repair is similar to stringer repair. 
Because the longeron is a heavy member and more strength 
is needed than with a stringer, heavy rivets are used in the 
repair. Sometimes bolts are used to install a longeron repair, 
due to the need for greater accuracy, they are not as suitable 
as rivets. Also, bolts require more time for installation.

If the longeron consists of a formed section and an extruded 
angle section, consider each section separately. A longeron 
repair is similar to a stringer repair, but keep the rivet pitch 
between 4 and 6 rivet diameters. If bolts are used, drill the 
bolt holes for a light drive fit.

Spar Repair
The spar is the main supporting member of the wing. Other 
components may also have supporting members called spars 
that serve the same function as the spar does in the wing. 
Think of spars as the hub, or base, of the section in which they 
are located, even though they are not in the center. The spar 
is usually the first member located during the construction of 
the section, and the other components are fastened directly 
or indirectly to it. Because of the load the spar carries, it is 
very important that particular care be taken when repairing 
this member to ensure the original strength of the structure 
is not impaired. The spar is constructed so that two general 
classes of repairs, web repairs and cap strip repairs, are 
usually necessary.

Figures 4-189 and 4-190 are examples of typical spar repairs. 
The damage to the spar web can be repaired with a round or 
rectangular doubler. Damage smaller than 1-inch is typically 
repaired with a round doubler and larger damage is repaired 
with a rectangular doubler. 

1. Remove the damage and radius all corners to 0.5-inch.

2. Fabricate doubler; use same material and thickness. 
The doubler size depends on edge distance (minimum 
of 2D) and rivet spacing (4-6D).

3. Drill through the doubler and the original skin and 
secure doubler with Clecos.

4. Install rivets.

Rib and Web Repair
Web repairs can be classified into two types:

1. Those made to web sections considered critical, such 
as those in the wing ribs.

2. Those considered less critical, such as those in 
elevators, rudders, flaps, and the like.

Web sections must be repaired in such a way that the original 
strength of the member is restored. In the construction of 
a member using a web, the web member is usually a light 
gauge aluminum alloy sheet forming the principal depth of 
the member. The web is bounded by heavy aluminum alloy 
extrusions known as cap strips. These extrusions carry the 
loads caused by bending and also provide a foundation for 
attaching the skin. The web may be stiffened by stamped 
beads, formed angles, or extruded sections riveted at regular 
intervals along the web.

The stamped beads are a part of the web itself and are stamped 
in when the web is made. Stiffeners help to withstand the 
compressive loads exerted upon the critically stressed web 
members. Often, ribs are formed by stamping the entire piece 
from sheet stock. That is, the rib lacks a cap strip, but does 
have a flange around the entire piece, plus lightning holes in 
the web of the rib. Ribs may be formed with stamped beads 
for stiffeners, or they may have extruded angles riveted on 
the web for stiffeners.

Most damages involve two or more members, but only one 
member may be damaged and need repairing. Generally, 
if the web is damaged, cleaning out the damaged area and 
installing a patch plate are all that is required.

The patch plate should be of sufficient size to ensure room for 
at least two rows of rivets around the perimeter of the damage 
that includes proper edge distance, pitch, and transverse pitch 
for the rivets. The patch plate should be of material having the 
same thickness and composition as the original member. If 
any forming is necessary when making the patch plate, such 
as fitting the contour of a lightning hole, use material in the 
“0” condition and then heat treat it after forming. 

Damage to ribs and webs, that require a repair larger than a 
simple plate, probably needs a patch plate, splice plates, or 
angles and an insertion. [Figure 4-191]

Leading Edge Repair
The leading edge is the front section of a wing, stabilizer, or 
other airfoil. The purpose of the leading edge is to streamline 
the forward section of the wings or control surfaces to 

ensure effective airflow. The space within the leading edge 
is sometimes used to store fuel. This space may also house 
extra equipment, such as landing lights, plumbing lines, or 
thermal anti-icing systems.

The construction of the leading edge section varies with the 
type of aircraft. Generally, it consists of cap strips, nose ribs, 
stringers, and skin. The cap strips are the main lengthwise

extrusions, and they stiffen the leading edges and furnish a 
base for the nose ribs and skin. They also fasten the leading 
edge to the front spar.

The nose ribs are stamped from aluminum alloy sheet or 
machined parts. These ribs are U-shaped and may have 
their web sections stiffened. Regardless of their design, their 
purpose is to give contour to the leading edge. Stiffeners 
are used to stiffen the leading edge and supply a base for 
fastening the nose skin. When fastening the nose skin, use 
only flush rivets.

Leading edges constructed with thermal anti-icing systems 
consist of two layers of skin separated by a thin air space. The 
inner skin, sometimes corrugated for strength, is perforated 
to conduct the hot air to the nose skin for anti-icing purposes.
Damage can be caused by contact with other objects, namely, 

pebbles, birds, and hail. However, the major cause of damage 
is carelessness while the aircraft is on the ground.

A damaged leading edge usually involves several structural 
parts. FOD probably involves the nose skin, nose ribs, 
stringers, and possibly the cap strip. Damage involving all 
of these members necessitates installing an access door to 
make the repair possible. First, the damaged area has to be 
removed and repair procedures established. The repair needs 
insertions and splice pieces. If the damage is serious enough, 
it may require repair of the cap strip and stringer, a new nose 
rib, and a skin panel. When repairing a leading edge, follow 
the procedures prescribed in the appropriate repair manual 
for this type of repair. [Figure 4-192] Repairs to leading 
edges are more difficult to accomplish than repairs to flat 
and straight structures because the repair parts need to be 
formed to fit the existing structure.
 
Trailing Edge Repair
A trailing edge is the rearmost part of an airfoil found on 
the wings, ailerons, rudders, elevators, and stabilizers. It is  
usually a metal strip that forms the shape of the edge by tying 
the ends of a rib section together and joining the upper and 
lower skins. Trailing edges are not structural members, but 
they are considered to be highly stressed in all cases.

Damage to a trailing edge may be limited to one point or 
extended over the entire length between two or more rib 
sections. Besides damage resulting from collision and 
careless handling, corrosion damage is often present. Trailing 
edges are particularly subject to corrosion because moisture 
collects or is trapped in them.

Thoroughly inspect the damaged area before starting repairs, 
and determine the extent of damage, the type of repair 
required, and the manner in which the repair should be 
performed. When making trailing edge repairs, remember 
that the repaired area must have the same contour and be 
made of material with the same composition and temper as 
the original section. The repair must also be made to retain 
the design characteristics of the airfoil. [Figure 4-193]

Specialized Repairs
Figures 4-194 through 4-198 are examples of repairs for 
various structural members. Specific dimensions are not 
included since the illustrations are intended to present the 
basic design philosophy of general repairs rather than be 
used as repair guidelines for actual structures. Remember to 
consult the SRM for specific aircraft to obtain the maximum 
allowable damage that may be repaired and the suggested 
method for accomplishing the repair.

Inspection Openings
If it is permitted by the applicable aircraft maintenance 
manual, installation of a flush access door for inspection 
purposes sometimes makes it easier to repair the internal 
structure as well as damage to the skin in certain areas. This 
installation consists of a doubler and a stressed cover plate. 
A single row of nut plates is riveted to the doubler, and the 
doubler is riveted to the skin with two staggered rows of 
rivets. [Figure 4-199] The cover plate is then attached to the 
doubler with machine screws.

Aircraft Welding
Introduction
Welding can be traced back to the Bronze Age, but it was 
not until the 19th century that welding as we know it today 
was invented. Some of the first successful commercially 
manufactured aircraft were constructed from welded steel 
tube frames. 

As the technology and manufacturing processes evolved 
in the aircraft and aerospace industry, lighter metals, such 
as aluminum, magnesium, and titanium, were used in their 
construction. New processes and methods of welding these 
metals were developed. This chapter provides some of the 
basic information needed to understand and initiate the 
various welding methods and processes.

Traditionally, welding is defined as a process that joins metal 
by melting or hammering the work pieces until they are 
united together. With the right equipment and instruction, 
almost anyone with some basic mechanical skill, dexterity, 
and practice can learn to weld.

There are three general types of welding: gas, electric arc, 
and electric resistance. Each type of welding has several 
variations, some of which are used in the construction of 
aircraft. Additionally, there are some new welding processes 
that have been developed in recent years that are highlighted 
for the purpose of information. 

This chapter addresses the welding equipment, methods, 
and various techniques used during the repair of aircraft and 
fabrication of component parts, including the processes of 
brazing and soldering of various metals.

Types of Welding
Gas Welding
Gas welding is accomplished by heating the ends or edges 
of metal parts to a molten state with a high temperature 
flame. The oxy-acetylene flame, with a temperature of 
approximately 6,300 °Fahrenheit (F), is produced with a torch 
burning acetylene and mixing it with pure oxygen. Hydrogen 
may be used in place of acetylene for aluminum welding, but 
the heat output is reduced to about 4,800 °F. Gas welding was 
the method most commonly used in production on aircraft 
materials under 3⁄16-inch in thickness until the mid 1950s, 
when it was replaced by electric welding for economic (not 
engineering) reasons. Gas welding continues to be a very 
popular and proven method for repair operations. 

Nearly all gas welding in aircraft fabrication is performed 
with oxy-acetylene welding equipment consisting of:

• Two cylinders, acetylene and oxygen.

• Acetylene and oxygen pressure regulators and cylinder 
pressure gauges.

• Two lengths of colored hose (red for acetylene and 
green for oxygen) with adapter connections for the 
regulators and torch.

• A welding torch with an internal mixing head, various 
size tips, and hose connections.

• Welding goggles fitted with appropriate colored lenses.

• A flint or spark lighter.

• Special wrench for acetylene tank valve if needed.

• An appropriately-rated fire extinguisher.

The equipment may be permanently installed in a shop, but 
most welding outfits are of the portable type. [Figure 5-1]

Electric Arc Welding
Electric arc welding is used extensively by the aircraft industry 
in both the manufacture and repair of aircraft. It can be used 
satisfactorily to join all weldable metals, provided that the 
proper processes and materials are used. The four types of 
electric arc welding are addressed in the following paragraphs. 

Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)
Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) is the most common type 
of welding and is usually referred to as “stick” welding. The 
equipment consists of a metal wire rod coated with a welding 
flux that is clamped in an electrode holder that is connected by a 
heavy electrical cable to a low voltage and high current in either 
alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC), depending on 
the type of welding being done. An arc is struck between the 
rod and the work and produces heat in excess of 10,000 °F, 
which melts both the material and the rod. The welding circuit 
consists of a welding machine, two leads, an electrode holder, 
an electrode, and the work to be welded. [Figure 5-2]

When the electrode is touched to the metal to be welded, 
the circuit is complete and the current flows. The electrode 
is then withdrawn from the metal approximately 1⁄4-inch to 
form an air gap between the metal and the electrode. If the 
correct gap is maintained, the current bridges the gap to form 
a sustained electric spark called the arc. This action melts the 
electrode and the coating of flux.

As the flux melts, it releases an inert gas that shields the 
molten puddle from oxygen in the air to prevent oxidation.

Figure 5-3. Stick welder–Shielded Metal Arc Welder (SMAW).

The molten flux covers the weld and hardens to an airtight 
slag that protects the weld bead as it cools. Some aircraft 
manufacturers, such as Stinson, used this process for the 
welding of 4130 steel fuselage structures. This was followed 
by heat treatment in an oven to stress relieve and normalize 
the structure. Shown in Figure 5-3 is a typical arc welding

Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) was formerly called gas 
inert gas (MIG) welding. It is an improvement over stick 
welding because an uncoated wire electrode is fed into and 
through the torch and an inert gas, such as argon, helium, 
or carbon dioxide, flows out around the wire to protect the 
puddle from oxygen. The power supply is connected to the 
torch and the work, and the arc produces the intense heat 
needed to melt the work and the electrode. [Figure 5-4]

Low-voltage, high-current DC is typically used with GMAW 
welding. Figure 5-5 shows the equipment required for a 
typical MIG welding setup. 

This method of welding can be used for large volume 
manufacturing and production work; it is not well suited to 
repair work because weld quality cannot be easily determined 
without destructive testing. Figure 5-6 depicts a typical power 
source used for MIG welding.

Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW)
Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is a method of electric arc 
welding that fills most of the needs in aircraft maintenance 
and repair when proper procedures and materials are used. It 
is the preferred method to use on stainless steel, magnesium, 
and most forms of thick aluminum. It is more commonly 
known as Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding and by the trade 
names of Heliarc or Heliweld. These names were derived 
from the inert helium gas that was originally used.

The first two methods of electric arc welding that were 
addressed used a consumable electrode that produced the 
filler for the weld. In TIG welding, the electrode is a tungsten 
rod that forms the path for the high amperage arc between it 
and the work to melt the metal at over 5,400 °F. The electrode 
is not consumed and used as filler so a filler rod is manually 
fed into the molten puddle in almost the same manner as 
when using an oxy-acetylene torch. A stream of inert gas, 
such as argon or helium, flows out around the electrode and 
envelopes the arc thereby preventing the formation of oxides 
in the molten puddle. [Figure 5-7]

The versatility of a TIG welder is increased by the choice of 
the power supply being used. DC of either polarity or AC 
may be used. [Figure 5-8]

and titanium; or

Electric Resistance Welding 
Electric resistance welding, either spot welding or seam 
welding, is typically used to join thin sheet metal components 
during the manufacturing process.

Spot Welding
Two copper electrodes are held in the jaws of the spot welding 
machine, and the material to be welded is clamped between 
them. Pressure is applied to hold the electrodes tightly 
together and electrical current flows through the electrodes 
and the material. The resistance of the material being welded 
is so much higher than that of the copper electrodes that 
enough heat is generated to melt the metal. The pressure on 
the electrodes forces the molten spots in the two pieces of 
metal to unite, and this pressure is held after the current stops 
flowing long enough for the metal to solidify. The amount of 
current, pressure, and dwell time are all carefully controlled 
and matched to the type of material and the thickness to 
produce the correct spot welds. [Figure 5-10]

Seam Welding
Rather than having to release the electrodes and move the 
material to form a series of spot welds, a seam-welding machine 
is used to manufacture fuel tanks and other components where 
a continuous weld is needed. Two copper wheels replace 
the bar-shaped electrodes. The metal to be welded is moved 
between them, and electric pulses create spots of molten metal 
that overlap to form the continuous seam.

Plasma Arc Welding (PAW)
Plasma arc welding (PAW) was developed in 1964 as a 
method of bringing better control to the arc welding process. 
PAW provides an advanced level of control and accuracy 

using automated equipment to produce high quality welds 
in miniature and precision applications. Furthermore, PAW 
is equally suited to manual operation and can be performed 
by a person using skills similar to those for GTAW. 

In the plasma welding torch, a nonconsumable tungsten 
electrode is located within a fine-bore copper nozzle. A 
pilot arc is initiated between the torch electrode and nozzle 
tip. This arc is then transferred to the metal being welded. 
[Figure 5-11]

By forcing the plasma gas and arc through a constricted 
orifice, the torch delivers a high concentration of heat to a 
small area. The plasma process produces exceptionally high 
quality welds. [Figure 5-12]


5-7

Plasma gas is normally argon. The torch also uses a secondary 
gas, such as argon/helium or argon/nitrogen, that assists in 
shielding the molten weld puddle and minimizing oxidation 
of the weld. 

Like GTAW, the PAW process can be used to weld most 
commercial metals, and it can be used for a wide variety 
of metal thicknesses. On thin material, from foil to 1⁄8-inch, 
the process is desirable because of the low heat input. The 
process provides relatively constant heat input because arc 
length variations are not very critical. On material thicknesses 
greater than 1⁄8-inch and using automated equipment, a 
keyhole technique is often used to produce full penetration 
single-path welds. In the keyhole technique, the plasma 
completely penetrates the work piece. The molten weld metal 
flows to the rear of the keyhole and solidifies as the torch 
moves on. The high quality welds produced are characterized 
by deep, narrow penetration and a small weld face.

When PAW is performed manually, the process requires 
a high degree of welding skills similar to that required for 
GTAW. However, the equipment is more complex and 
requires a high degree of knowledge to set up and use. The 
equipment required for PAW includes a welding machine, a 
special plasma arc control system, the plasma welding torch 
(water-cooled), the source of plasma and shielding gas, and 
filler material, when required. Because of the cost associated 
with this equipment, this process is very limited outside of 
manufacturing facilities.

Plasma Arc Cutting 
When a plasma cutting torch is used, the gas is usually 
compressed air. The plasma cutting machine works by 
constricting an electrical arc in a nozzle and forcing the 
ionized gas through it. This heats the gas that melts the metal 
which is blown away by the air pressure. By increasing air 
pressure and intensifying the arc with higher voltages, the 
cutter is capable of blasting through thicker metals and 
blowing away the dross with minimal cleanup. 

Plasma arc systems can cut all electrically conductive metals, 
including aluminum and stainless steel. These two metals 
cannot be cut by oxy-fuel cutting systems because they have 
an oxide layer that prevents oxidation from occurring. Plasma 
cutting works well on thin metals and can successfully cut 
brass and copper in excess of two inches thick. 

Plasma cutting machines can rapidly and precisely cut 
through, gouge, or pierce any electrically conductive metal 
without preheating. The plasma cutter produces a precise 
kerf (cut) width and a small heat-affected zone (HAZ) that 
prevents warping and damage.

Gas Welding and Cutting Equipment
Welding Gases  
Acetylene
This is the primary fuel for oxy-fuel welding and cutting. It 
is chemically very unstable, and is stored in special cylinders 
designed to keep the gas dissolved. The cylinders are packed 
with a porous material and then saturated with acetone. When 
the acetylene is added to the cylinder, it dissolves; in this 
solution, it becomes stable. Pure acetylene stored in a free 
state explodes from a slight shock at 29.4 pounds per square 
inch (psi). The acetylene pressure gauge should never be set 
higher than 15 psi for welding or cutting. 

Argon
Argon is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-toxic inert 
gas. Inert gas cannot combine with other elements. It has a 
very low chemical reactivity and low thermal conductivity. 
It is used as a gas shield for the electrode in MIG, TIG, and 
plasma welding equipment. 

Helium
Helium is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-toxic 
inert gas. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest of the 
elements and it normally exists only in gas form. It is used 
as a protective gas shield for many industrial uses including 
electric arc welding.

Hydrogen
Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and highly 
flammable gas. It can be used at a higher pressure than 
acetylene and is used for underwater welding and cutting. 
It also can be used for aluminum welding using the oxy-
hydrogen process.

Oxygen
Oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and nonflammable gas. It is 
used in the welding process to increase the combustion rate 
which increases the flame temperature of flammable gas. 

Pressure Regulators
A pressure regulator  is attached to a gas cylinder and is used 
to lower the cylinder pressure to the desired working pressure. 
Regulators have two gauges, one indicating the pressure in 
the cylinder and the second showing the working pressure. 
By turning the adjustment knob in or out, a spring operating 
a flexible diaphragm opens or closes a valve in the regulator. 
Turning the knob in causes the flow and pressure to increase; 
backing it out decreases the flow and pressure.


5-8

Figure 5-13. Single-stage acetylene regulator. Note the maximum 
15-psi working pressure. The notched groove cylinder connection 
nut indicates a left-hand thread.

Figure 5-14. Two-stage oxygen regulator. No groove on the cylinder 
connection nut indicates a right-hand thread.

Figure 5-15. Check valves.

There are two types of regulators: single stage and two stage. 
They perform the same function but the two-stage regulator 
maintains a more constant outlet pressure and flow as the 
cylinder volume and pressure drops. Two-stage regulators 
can be identified by a larger, second pressure chamber under 
the regulator knob. [Figures 5-13 and 5-14]

Welding Hose
A welding hose connects the regulators to the torch. It is 
typically a double hose joined together during manufacture. 
The acetylene hose is red and has left hand threads indicated 
by a groove cut into the connection nut. The oxygen hose is 
green and has right hand threads indicated by the absence of 
a groove on the connection nut. 

Welding hoses are produced in different sizes from ¼-inch to 
½-inch inside diameter (ID). The hose should be marked for 
light, standard, and heavy duty service plus a grade indicating 
whether it has an oil- and/or flame-resistant cover. The hose 
should have the date of manufacture, maximum working 
pressure of 200 psi, and indicate that it meets specification 
IP-90 of the Rubber Manufacturers Association and the 
Compressed Gas Association for rubber welding hoses. 
Grade-R hose should only be used with acetylene gas. A 
T-grade hose must be used with propane, MAPP®, and all 
other fuel gases.
   
Check Valves and Flashback Arrestors
The check valve stops the reverse flow of the gas and can 
be installed either between the regulator and the hose or the 
hose and the torch. [Figure 5-15]  Excessive overheating 
of cutting, welding, and heating tips can cause flashback 
conditions. A flashback can be caused when a tip is 
overheated and the gas ignites before passing out of the 
tip. The flame is then burning internally rather than on the 
outside of the tip and is usually identified by a shrill hissing 
or squealing noise. 

A flashback arrestor installed on each hose prevents a high 
pressure flame or oxygen-fuel mixture from being pushed 
back into either cylinder causing an explosion. The flashback 
arrestors incorporate a check valve that stops the reverse flow 
of gas and the advancement of a flashback fire. [Figure 5-16]

Torches
Equal Pressure Torch
The equal pressure torch is the most commonly used torch 
for oxy-acetylene welding. It has a mixing chamber and uses 
acetylene fuel at 1–15 psi. The flame is easy to adjust and 
there is less chance of flashback with this torch. There are

several small lightweight torches of this type that are ideal 
for aviation welding projects. The Smith Airline™ and the 
Meco Midget™ torches are small enough to be used in close 
confined areas, lightweight enough to reduce fatigue during 
long welding sessions yet, with the appropriate tips, are 
capable of welding 0.250-inch steel.  
  
Injector Torch
The injector torch uses fuel gas at pressures between just 
above 0 and 2 psi. This torch is typically used with propane 
and propylene gas. High-pressure oxygen comes through 
a small nozzle inside the torch head and pulls the fuel gas 
along with it via a venturi effect. The low-pressure injector 
torch is more prone to flashback. 

Cutting Torch
The cutting torch is an attachment added to the torch handle 
that allows the cutting of metal. The cutting process is 
fundamentally the rapid burning or oxidizing of the metal 
in a localized area. The metal is heated to a bright red color 
(1,400 °F to 1,600 °F), which is the kindling temperature, 
using only the preheat jets. Then, a jet of high-pressure 
oxygen released by the lever on the cutting attachment is 
directed against the heated metal. This oxygen blast combines 
with the hot metal and forms an intensely hot oxide. The 
molten oxide is blown down the sides of the cut, heating the 
metal in its path to the kindling temperature as the torch is 
moved along the line of the desired cut. The heated metal 
also burns to an oxide that is blown away on the underside 
of the piece. [Figure 5-17]

Torch Tips
The torch tip delivers and controls the final flow of gases. 
It is important that you use the correct tip with the proper 
gas pressures for the work to be welded satisfactorily. The 
size of the tip opening—not the temperature—determines 
the amount of heat applied to the work. If an excessively 
small tip is used, the heat provided is insufficient to produce 
penetration to the proper depth. If the tip is too large, the heat 

is too great, and holes are burned in the metal. 
Torch tip sizes are designated by numbers. The manufacturer 
can provide a chart with recommended sizes for welding 
specific thicknesses of metal. With use, a torch tip becomes 
clogged with carbon deposits. If it is allowed to contact the 
molten pool, particles of slag may clog the tip. This may 
cause a backfire, which is a momentary backward flow of 
the gases at the torch tip. A backfire is rarely dangerous, but 
molten metal may be splattered when the flame pops. Tips 
should be cleaned with the proper size tip cleaner to avoid 
enlarging the tip opening.

Welding Eyewear
Protective eyewear for use with oxy-fuel welding outfits is 
available in several styles and must be worn to protect the 
welder’s eyes from the bright flame and flying sparks. This 
eyewear is not for use with arc welding equipment. 

Some of the styles available have individual lenses and 
include goggles that employ a head piece and/or an elastic 
head strap to keep them snug around the eyes for protection 
from the occasional showering spark. [Figure 5-18] Another 
popular style is the rectangular eye shield that takes a standard 
2-inch by 4.25-inch lens. This style is available with an 
elastic strap but is far more comfortable and better fitting 
when attached to a proper fitting adjustable headgear. It can 
be worn over prescription glasses, provides protection from

flying sparks, and accepts a variety of standard shade and 
color lenses. A clear safety glass lens is added in front of the 
shaded lens to protect it from damage. [Figure 5-19]

It was standard practice in the past to select a lens shade for 
gas welding based on the brightness of flame emitting from 
the torch. The darkest shade of lens showing a clear definition 
of the work was normally the most desirable. However, when 
flux was used for brazing and welding, the torch heat caused 
the sodium in the flux to give off a brilliant yellow-orange 
flare, hiding a clear view of the weld area and causing many 
eye problems. 

Various types of lens and colors were tried for periods of time 
without much success. It was not until the late 1980s that 
TM Technologies developed and patented a new green glass 
designed especially for aluminum oxy-fuel welding. It not 
only eliminated the sodium orange flare completely, but also 
provided the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, 
and blue light, and impact to meet the requirements of  the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z87-1989 
Safety Standards for a special purpose lens. This lens can be 
used for welding and brazing all metals using an oxy-fuel torch. 

Torch Lighters
Torch lighters are called friction lighters or flint strikers. The 
lighter consists of a file-shaped piece of steel, usually recessed 
in a cuplike device, and a replaceable flint, which when drawn 
across the steel produces a shower of sparks to light the fuel 
gas. An open flame or match should never be used to light a 
torch, because accumulated gas may envelop the hand and 
when ignited cause a severe burn. [Figure 5-20] 

Filler Rod
The use of the proper type of filler rod is very important 
for oxy-acetylene welding. This material adds not only 
reinforcement to the weld area, but also desired properties to 
the finished weld. By selecting the proper rod, tensile strength 
or ductility can be secured in a weld. Similarly, the proper rod 
can help retain the desired amount of corrosion resistance. In 

some cases, a suitable rod with a lower melting point helps 
to avoid cracks caused by expansion and contraction.

Welding rods may be classified as ferrous or nonferrous. 
Ferrous rods include carbon and alloy steel rods, as well as 
cast-iron rods. Nonferrous rods include brass, aluminum, 
magnesium, copper, silver, and their various alloys.

Welding rods are manufactured in standard 36-inch lengths 
and in diameters from 1⁄16-inch to 3⁄8-inch. The diameter of the 
rod to be used is governed by the thickness of the metals to 
be joined. If the rod is too small, it cannot conduct heat away 
from the puddle rapidly enough, and a burned hole results. 
A rod too large in diameter draws heat away and chills the 
puddle, resulting in poor penetration of the joined metal. All 
filler rods should be cleaned prior to use.
 
Equipment Setup
Setting up acetylene welding equipment in preparation for 
welding should be accomplished in a systematic and definite 
order to avoid costly damage to equipment and compromising 
the safety of personnel. 

Gas Cylinders
All cylinders should be stored and transported in the upright 
position, especially acetylene cylinders, because they contain 
an absorbent material saturated with liquid acetone. If the 
cylinder were laid on its side, allowing the acetone to enter 
and contaminate the regulator, hose, and torch, fuel starvation 
and a resultant flashback in the system could result. If an 
acetylene cylinder must be placed on its side for a period of 
time, it must be stored in the upright position for at least twice 
as long before being used. Gas cylinders should be secured, 
usually with a chain, in a permanent location or in a suitable 
mobile cart. The cylinder’s protective steel cap should not 
be removed until the cylinder is put into service. 

Regulators
Prior to installing the regulator on a gas cylinder, open the 
cylinder shutoff valve for an instant to blow out any foreign 
material that may be lodged in the outlet. Close the valve and 
wipe off the connection with a clean oil-free cloth. Connect 
the acetylene pressure regulator to the acetylene cylinder 


5-11

and tighten the left-hand nut. Connect the oxygen pressure 
regulator to the oxygen cylinder and tighten the right-hand 
nut. The connection fittings are brass and do not require a lot 
of torque to prevent them from leaking. At this time, check 
to ensure the adjusting screw on each pressure regulator is 
backed out by turning counterclockwise until it turns freely. 

Hoses
Connect the red hose with the left-hand threads to the 
acetylene pressure regulator and the green hose with the 
right-hand threads to the oxygen pressure regulator. This 
is the location, between the regulator and hose, in which 
flashback arrestors should be installed. Again, because the 
fittings are brass and easily damaged, tighten only enough 
to prevent leakage. 

Stand off to the side away from the face of the gauges. Now, 
very slowly open the oxygen cylinder valve and read the 
cylinder gauge to check the contents in the tank. The oxygen 
cylinder shutoff valve has a double seat valve and should be 
opened fully against its stop to seat the valve and prevent a 
leak. The acetylene cylinder shutoff valve should be slowly 
opened just enough to get the cylinder pressure reading on 
the regulator and then one half of a turn more. This allows a 
quick shutoff, if needed. 

NOTE: As a recommended safety practice, the cylinders 
should not be depleted in content below 20 psi. This prevents 
the possible reverse flow of gas from the opposite tank.

Both hoses should be blown out before attaching to the torch. 
This is accomplished for each cylinder by turning the pressure 
adjusting screw in (clockwise) until the gas escapes, and then 
quickly backing the screw out (counterclockwise) to shut 
off the flow. This should be done in a well ventilated open 
space, free from sparks, flames, or other sources of ignition. 

Connecting Torch
Connect the red hose with the left-hand thread connector 
nut to the left-hand thread fitting on the torch. Connect the 
green hose with the right-hand thread connector nut to the 
right-hand thread fitting on the torch. Close the valves on the 
torch handle and check all connections for leaks as follows:

• Turn in the adjusting screw on the oxygen pressure 
regulator until the working pressure indicates 10 psi. 
Turn in the adjusting screw on the acetylene pressure 
regulator until the working pressure indicates 5 psi.

• Back out both adjusting screws on the regulators and 
verify that the working pressure remains steady. If it 
drops and pressure is lost, a leak is indicated between 
the regulator and the torch.

• A general tightening of all connections should fix the 
leak. Repeat a check of the system. 

• If a leak is still indicated by a loss in working pressure, 
a mixture of soapy water on all the connections reveals 
the source of the leak. Never check for a leak with a 
flame because a serious explosion could occur.

Select the Tip Size
Welding and cutting tips are available in a variety of sizes 
for almost any job, and are identified by number. The higher 
the number is, the bigger the hole in the tip is allowing more 
heat to be directed onto the metal and allowing thicker metal 
to be welded or cut.

Welding tips have one hole and cutting tips have a number 
of holes. The cutting tip has one large hole in the center for 
the cutting oxygen and a number of smaller holes around 
it that supply fuel, gas, and oxygen for the preheating 
flame. The selection of the tip size is very important, not 
only for the quality of the weld and/or the efficiency of the 
cutting process, but for the overall operation of the welding 
equipment and safety of the personnel using it. 

Starvation occurs if torch tips are operated at less than 
the required volume of gas, leading to tip overheating 
and possible f lashbacks.  Incorrect  t ip size and 
obstructed tip orifices can also cause overheating and/or  
flashback conditions. 

All fuel cylinders have a limited capacity to deliver gas to 
the tip. That capacity is further limited by the gas contents 
remaining in the cylinder and the temperature of the cylinder.

The following provides some recommended procedures to 
guard against overheating and flashbacks:

• Refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations for tip 
size based on the metal’s thickness.

• Use the recommended gas pressure settings for the tip 
size being used.

• Provide the correct volume of gas as recommended 
for each tip size.

• Do not use an excessively long hose, one with multiple 
splices, or one that may be too small in diameter and 
restrict the flow of gas. 

NOTE: Acetylene is limited to a maximum continuous 
withdrawal rate of one-seventh of the cylinder’s rated 
capacity when full. For example, an acetylene cylinder that 
has a capacity of 330 cubic feet has a maximum withdrawal 
of 47 cubic feet per hour. This is determined by dividing 330

Figure 5-21. Chart of recommended tip sizes for welding various thicknesses of metal.

(cylinder capacity) by 7 (one-seventh of the cylinder capacity).
As a safety precaution, it is recommended that flashback 
arrestors be installed between the regulators and the gas 
supply hoses of all welding outfits. Figure 5-21 shows 
recommended tip sizes of different manufacturers, for 
welding various thickness of metals. 

Adjusting the Regulator Working Pressure
The working pressure should be set according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendation for the tip size that is being 
used to weld or cut. This is a recommended method that works 
for most welding and cutting operations. 

In a well ventilated area, open the acetylene valve on the 
torch and turn the adjusting screw on the acetylene pressure 
regulator clockwise until the desired pressure is set. Close the 
acetylene valve on the torch. Then, set the oxygen pressure in 
the same manner by opening the oxygen valve on the torch 
and turning the adjusting screw clockwise on the oxygen 
regulator until desired pressure is set. Then, close the oxygen 
valve on the torch handle. With the working pressures set, 
the welding or cutting operation can be initiated.

Figure 5-22. Oxy-acetylene flames.

Lighting and Adjusting the Torch 
With the proper working pressures set for the acetylene and 
oxygen, open the torch acetylene valve a quarter to a half turn. 
Direct the torch away from the body and ignite the acetylene 
gas with the flint striker. Open the acetylene valve until the 
black sooty smoke disappears from the flame. The pure 
acetylene flame is long, bushy, and has a yellowish color. 
Open the torch oxygen valve slowly and the flame shortens 
and turns to a bluish-white color that forms a bright inner 
luminous cone surrounded by an outer flame envelope. This 
is a neutral flame that should be set before either a carburizing 
or oxidizing flame mixture is set.

Different Flames
The three types of flame commonly used for welding are 
neutral, carburizing, and oxidizing. Each serves a specific 
purpose. [Figure 5-22]

Neutral Flame
The neutral flame burns at approximately 5,850 °F at the tip 
of the inner luminous cone and is produced by a balanced 
mixture of acetylene and oxygen supplied by the torch. The 
neutral flame is used for most welding because it does not 
alter the composition of the base metal. When using this 
flame on steel, the molten metal puddle is quiet and clear, 
and the metal flows to give a thoroughly fused weld without 
burning or sparking.

Carburizing Flame
The carburizing flame burns at approximately 5,700 °F at 
the tip of the inner core. It is also referred to as a reducing 
flame because it tends to reduce the amount of oxygen in the 
iron oxides. The flame burns with a coarse rushing sound, 
and has a bluish-white inner cone, a white center cone, and 
a light blue outer cone.

The flame is produced by burning more acetylene than 
oxygen, and can be recognized by the greenish feathery tip at 
the end of the cone. The longer the feather, the more acetylene 
is in the mix. For most welding operations, the length of the 
feather should be about twice the length of the inner cone. 

The carburizing flame is best used for welding high-carbon 
steels, for hard facing, and for welding such nonferrous alloys 
as aluminum, nickel, and Monel.

Oxidizing Flame
The oxidizing flame burns at approximately 6,300 °F and 
is produced by burning an excess of oxygen. It takes about 
two parts of oxygen to one part acetylene to produce this 
flame. It can be identified by the shorter outer flame and the 
small, white, inner cone. To obtain this flame, start with a 
neutral flame and then open the oxygen valve until the inner 
cone is about one-tenth of its original length. The oxidizing 
flame makes a hissing sound, and the inner cone is somewhat 
pointed and purplish in color at the tip.

The oxidizing flame does have some specific uses. A slightly 
oxidizing flame is used for bronze welding (brazing) of steel 
and cast iron. A stronger oxidizing flame is used for fusion 
welding of brass and bronze. If an oxidizing flame is used 
on steel, it causes the molten metal to foam, give off sparks, 
and burn.

Soft or Harsh Flames
With each size of tip, a neutral, carburizing, or oxidizing 
flame can be obtained. It is also possible to obtain a soft or 
harsh flame by decreasing or increasing the working pressure 
of both gases (observing the maximum working pressure of 
15 psi for acetylene gas).

For some work, it may be desirable to have a soft or low 
velocity flame without a reduction of thermal output. This 
can be achieved by reducing the working pressure using a 
larger tip and closing the torch valves until the neutral flame is 
quiet and steady. It is especially desirable to use a soft flame 
when welding aluminum to avoid blowing holes in the metal 
when the puddle is formed. 
  
Handling of the Torch
It should be cautioned that improper adjustment or handling 
of the torch may cause the flame to backfire or, in rare 
cases, to flashback. A backfire is a momentary backward 
flow of gases at the torch tip that causes the flame to go out. 
A backfire may be caused by touching the tip against the 
work, overheating the tip, by operating the torch at other than 
recommended pressures, by a loose tip or head, or by dirt or 
slag in the end of the tip, and may cause molten metal to be 
splattered when the flame pops.


5-14

Figure 5-23. Cutting torch with additional tools.

A flashback is dangerous because it is the burning of gases 
within the torch. It is usually caused by loose connections, 
improper pressures, or overheating of the torch. A shrill 
hissing or squealing noise accompanies a flashback, and 
unless the gases are turned off immediately, the flame may 
burn back through the hose and regulators causing great 
damage and personal injury. The cause of the flashback 
should always be determined and the problem corrected 
before relighting the torch. All gas welding outfits should 
have a flashback arrestor. 
 
Oxy-acetylene Cutting
Cutting ferrous metals by the oxy-acetylene process is 
primarily the rapid burning or oxidizing of the metal in a 
localized area. This is a quick and inexpensive way to cut 
iron and steel where a finished edge is not required.

Figure 5-23 shows an example of a cutting torch. It has 
the conventional oxygen and acetylene valves in the torch 
handle that control the flow of the two gases to the cutting 
head. It also has an oxygen valve below the oxygen lever on 
the cutting head so that a finer adjustment of the flame can 
be obtained.

The size of the cutting tip is determined by the thickness of 
the metal to be cut. Set the regulators to the recommended 
working pressures for the cutting torch based on the tip size 
selected. Before beginning any cutting operation, the area 
should be clear of all combustible material and the proper 
protective equipment should be worn by personnel engaged 
in the cutting operation. 

The flame for the torch in Figure 5-23 is set by first closing 
the oxygen valve below the cutting lever and fully opening the 
oxygen valve on the handle. (This supplies the high-pressure 
oxygen blast when the cutting lever is actuated.) The acetylene 
valve on the handle is then opened and the torch is lit with a 
striker. The acetylene flame is increased until the black soot 
is gone. Then, open the oxygen valve below the cutting lever 
and adjust the flame to neutral. If more heat is needed, open the 
valves to add more acetylene and oxygen. Actuate the cutting 
lever and readjust the preheat flame to neutral if necessary. 

The metal is heated to a bright red color (1,400 °F–1,600 °F, 
which is the kindling or ignition temperature) by the preheat 
orifices in the tip of the cutting torch. Then, a jet of high-
pressure oxygen is directed against it by pressing the oxygen 
lever on the torch. This oxygen blast combines with the 
red-hot metal and forms an intensely hot molten oxide that 
is blown down the sides of the cut. As the torch is moved 
along the intended cut line, this action continues heating 
the metal in its path to the kindling temperature. The metal, 
thus heated, also burns to an oxide that is blown away to the 
underside of the piece.

Proper instruction and practice provides the knowledge and 
skill to become proficient in the technique needed to cut 
with a torch. Hold the torch in either hand, whichever is 
most comfortable. Use the thumb of that hand to operate the 
oxygen cutting lever. Use the other hand to rest the torch on 
and steady it along the cut line. 

Begin at the edge of the metal and hold the tip perpendicular 
to the surface, preheating until the spot turns bright red. 
Lightly depress the cutting lever to allow a shower of sparks 
and molten metal to blow through the cut. Fully depress the 
cutting lever and move the torch slowly in the direction of 
the intended cut. 

Practice and experience allow the technician to learn how to 
judge the speed at which to move the torch. It should be just 
fast enough to allow the cut to penetrate completely without 
excessive melting around the cut. If the torch is moved too fast, 
the metal will not be preheated enough, and the cutting action 
stops. If this happens, release the cutting lever, preheat the 
cut to bright red, depress the lever, and continue with the cut.

Shutting Down the Gas Welding Equipment
Shutting down the welding equipment is fairly simple when 
some basic steps are followed:

• Turn off the flame by closing the acetylene valve on 
the torch first. This shuts the flame off quickly. Then, 
close the oxygen valve on the torch handle. Also, close 
oxygen valve on cutting torch, if applicable. 

• If the equipment is not used in the immediate future 
(approximately the next 30 minutes), the valves on 
the acetylene and oxygen cylinders should be closed 
and pressure relieved from the hoses.

• In a well-ventilated area, open the acetylene valve on 
the torch and allow the gas to escape to the outside 
atmosphere, and then close the valve.

• Open the oxygen valve on the torch, allow the gas to 
escape, and then close the valve.

• Close both the acetylene and oxygen regulators by 
backing out the adjusting screw counterclockwise 
until loose.

• Carefully coil the hose to prevent kinking and store it 
to prevent damage to the torch and tip. 

Gas Welding Procedures and Techniques
The material to be welded, the thickness of the metal, the type 
of joint, and the position of the weld dictates the procedure 
and technique to be used.

When light-gauge metal is welded, the torch is usually held 
with the hose draped over the wrist. [Figure 5-24] To weld 
heavy materials, the more common grip may provide better 
control of the torch. [Figure 5-25]

The torch should be held in the most comfortable position that 
allows the tip to be in line with the joint to be welded, and 
inclined between 30° and 60° from the perpendicular. This 
position preheats the edges just ahead of the molten puddle. 
The best angle depends on the type of weld, the amount of 
preheating required, and the thickness and type of metal. 
The thicker the metal, the more vertical the torch must be for 
proper heat penetration. The white cone of the flame should 
be held about 1⁄8-inch from the surface of the metal.

Welding can be performed by pointing the torch flame in the 
direction that the weld is progressing. This is referred to as 
forehand welding, and is the most commonly used method 
for lighter tubing and sheet metal. The filler rod is kept ahead 
of the tip in the direction the weld is going and is added to 
the puddle. 

For welding thick metals or heavy plate, a technique called 
backhand welding can be used. In this method, the torch 
flame is pointed back toward the finished weld and the filler 
rod is added between the flame and the weld. This method 
provides a greater concentration of heat for welding thicker 
metals and would rarely be used in aircraft maintenance. 

Puddle

If the torch is held in the correct position, a small puddle 
of molten metal forms. The puddle should be centered in 
the joint and composed of equal parts of those pieces being 
welded. After the puddle appears, the tip should be moved 
in a semicircular arc or circular motion equally between the 
pieces to ensure an even distribution of heat.

Adding Filler Rod to the Puddle

As the metal melts and the puddle forms, filler rod is needed 
to replace the metal that flows out from around the joint. 


5-16

The rod is added to the puddle in the amount that provides 
for the completed fillet to be built up about one-fourth the 
thickness of the base metal. The filler rod selected should be 
compatible with the base metal being welded. 

Correct Forming of a Weld
The form of the weld metal has considerable bearing upon 
the strength and fatigue resistance of a joint. The strength 
of an improperly made weld is usually less than the strength 
for which the joint was designed. Low-strength welds are 
generally the result of insufficient penetration; undercutting 
of the base metal at the toe of the weld; poor fusion of the 
weld metal with the base metal; trapped oxides, slag, or gas 
pockets in the weld; overlap of the weld metal on the base 
metal; too much or too little reinforcement; or overheating 
of the weld.

Characteristics of a Good Weld
A completed weld should have the following characteristics:

1. The seam should be smooth, the bead ripples evenly 
spaced, and of a uniform thickness.

2. The weld should be built up, slightly convex, thus 
providing extra thickness at the joint.

3. The weld should taper off smoothly into the  
base metal.

4. No oxide should be formed on the base metal close to 
the weld.

5. The weld should show no signs of blowholes, porosity, 
or projecting globules.

6. The base metal should show no signs of burns, pits, 
cracks, or distortion. 

Although a clean, smooth weld is desirable, this characteristic 
does not necessarily mean that the weld is a good one; it may 
be dangerously weak inside. However, when a weld is rough, 
uneven, and pitted, it is almost always unsatisfactory inside. 
Welds should never be filed to give them a better appearance, 
since filing deprives the weld of part of its strength. Welds 
should never be filled with solder, brazing material, or filler 
of any sort.

When it is necessary to reweld a joint, all old weld material 
must be removed before the operation is begun. It must be 
remembered that reheating the area may cause the base metal 
to lose some of its strength and become brittle. This should 
not be confused with a post-weld heat treatment that does not 
raise the metal to a high enough temperature to cause harm 
to the base material.

Oxy-Acetylene Welding of Ferrous Metals 
Steel (Including SAE 4130)
Low-carbon steel, low-alloy steel (e.g., 4130), cast steel, and 
wrought iron are easily welded with the oxy-acetylene flame. 
Low-carbon and low-alloy steels are the ferrous materials 
that are gas welded most frequently. As the carbon content of 
steel increases, it may be repaired by welding using specific 
procedures for various alloy types. Factors involved are the 
carbon content and hardenability. For corrosion-resistant 
and heat-resistant nickel chromium steels, the allowed 
weldability depends upon their stability, carbon content, and 
reheat treatment.

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the 
American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) provide a 
designation system that is an accepted standard for the 
industry. SAE 4130 is an alloy steel that is an ideal material 
for constructing fuselages and framework on small aircraft; it 
is also used for motorcycle and high-end bicycle frames and 
race car frames and roll cages. The tubing has high tensile 
strength, malleability, and is easy to weld. 

The number ‘4130’ is also an AISI 4-digit code that defines 
the approximate chemical composition of the steel. The 
‘41’ indicates a low-alloy steel containing chromium and 
molybdenum (chromoly) and the ‘30’ designates a carbon 
content of 0.3 percent. 4130 steel also contains small amounts 
of manganese, phosphorus, sulfur, and silicon, but like all 
steels, it contains mostly iron.

In order to make a good weld, the carbon content of the 
steel must not be altered to any appreciable degree, nor 
can other atmospheric chemical constituents be added to or 
subtracted from the base metal without seriously altering the 
properties of the metal. However, many welding filler wires 
do contain constituents different from the base material for 
specific reasons, which is perfectly normal and acceptable if 
approved materials are used. Molten steel has a great affinity 
for carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen combining with the molten 
puddle to form oxides and nitrates, both of which lower the 
strength of steel. When welding with an oxy-acetylene flame, 
the inclusion of impurities can be minimized by observing 
the following precautions:

• Maintain an exact neutral flame for most steels and 
a slight excess of acetylene when welding alloys 
with a high nickel or chromium content, such as  
stainless steel.

• Maintain a soft flame and control the puddle.


5-17

• Maintain a flame sufficient to penetrate the metal and 
manipulate it so that the molten metal is protected from 
the air by the outer envelope of flame.

• Keep the hot end of the welding rod in the weld pool 
or within the flame envelope.

• When the weld is complete and still in the red heat, 
circle the outer envelope of the torch around the entire 
weldment to bring it evenly to a dull red. Slowly back 
the torch away from the weldment to ensure a slow 
cooling rate.

Chrome Molybdenum
The welding technique for chrome molybdenum (chrome-
moly) is practically the same as that for carbon steels, except 
for sections over 3⁄16-inch thick. The surrounding area must be 
preheated to a temperature between 300 °F and 400 °F before 
beginning to weld. If this is not done, the sudden quenching 
of the weld area after the weld is complete may cause a 
brittle grain structure of untempered martensite that must 
be eliminated with post-weld heat treatments. Untempered 
martensite is a glass-like structure that takes the place of the 
normally ductile steel structure and makes the steel prone to 
cracking, usually near the edge of the weld. This preheating 
also helps to alleviate some of the distortion caused by 
welding along with using proper practices found in other 
sections of this chapter. 

A soft neutral flame should be used for welding and must be 
maintained during the process. If the flame is not kept neutral, 
an oxidizing flame may cause oxide inclusions and fissures. 
A carburizing flame makes the metal more hardenable by 
raising the carbon content. The volume of the flame must 
be sufficient to melt the base metal, but not hot enough to 
overheat the base metal and cause oxide inclusions or a loss 
of metal thickness. The filler rod should be compatible with 
the base metal. If the weld requires high strength, special low-
alloy filler is used, and the piece is heat treated after welding.

It may be advantageous to TIG weld 4130 chrome-moly 
sections over 0.093-inch thickness followed by a proper 
post-weld heat treatment as this can result in less overall 
distortion. However, do not eliminate the post-weld heat 
treatment as doing so could severely limit the fatigue life of 
the weldment due to the formed martensitic grain structure.

Stainless Steel
The procedure for welding stainless steel is basically the 
same as that for carbon steels. There are, however, some 
special precautions you must take to obtain the best results.

Only stainless steel used for nonstructural members of aircraft 
can be welded satisfactorily. The stainless steel used for 

structural components is cold worked or cold rolled and, if 
heated, loses some of its strength. Nonstructural stainless 
steel is obtained in sheet and tubing form and is often used for 
exhaust collectors, stacks, or manifolds. Oxygen combines 
very readily with this metal in the molten state, and you must 
take extreme care to prevent this from occurring.

A slightly carburizing flame is recommended for welding 
stainless steel. The flame should be adjusted so that a feather 
of excess acetylene, about 1⁄16-inch long, forms around the 
inner cone. Too much acetylene, however, adds carbon to 
the metal and causes it to lose its resistance to corrosion. 
The torch tip size should be one or two sizes smaller than 
that prescribed for a similar gauge of low-carbon steel. The 
smaller tip lessens the chances of overheating and subsequent 
loss of the corrosion-resistant qualities of the metal.

To prevent the formation of chromium oxide, a specially 
compounded flux for stainless steel, should be used. The flux, 
when mixed with water, can be spread on the underside of the 
joint and on the filler rod. Since oxidation must be avoided 
as much as possible, use sufficient flux. The filler rod used 
should be of the same composition as the base metal.

When welding, hold the filler rod within the envelope of the 
torch flame so that the rod is melted in place or melted at the 
same time as the base metal. Add the filler rod by allowing 
it to flow into the molten pool. Do not stir the weld pool, 
because air enters the weld and increases oxidation. Avoid 
rewelding any portion or welding on the reverse side of the 
weld, which results in warping and overheating of the metal.

Another method used to keep oxygen from reaching the 
metal is to surround the weld with a blanket of inert gas. 
This is done by using a TIG welder to perform welding of 
stainless steel. It is a recommended method for excellent 
weld results and does not require the application of flux and 
its subsequent cleanup. 

Oxy-Acetylene Welding of Nonferrous 
Metals
Nonferrous metals are those that contain no iron. Examples 
of nonferrous metals are lead, copper, silver, magnesium, 
and the most important in aircraft construction, aluminum. 
Some of these metals are lighter than the ferrous metals, 
but in most cases, they are not as strong. Aluminum 
manufacturers have compensated for the lack of strength of 
pure aluminum by alloying it with other metals or by cold 
working it. For still greater strength, some aluminum alloys 
are also heat treated.  


5-18

Aluminum Welding
Gas welding of certain aluminum alloys can be accomplished 
successfully, but it requires some practice and the appropriate 
equipment to produce a successful weld. Before attempting 
to weld aluminum for the first time, become familiar with 
how the metal reacts under the welding flame.

A good example for practice and to see how aluminum 
reacts to a welding flame, heat a piece of aluminum sheet 
on a welding bench. Hold a torch with a neutral flame 
perpendicular to the sheet and bring the tip of the inner 
cone almost in contact with the metal. Observe that the 
metal suddenly melts away, almost without any indication, 
and leaves a hole in the metal. Now repeat the operation, 
only this time hold the torch at an angle of about 30° to the 
surface. This allows for better control of the heat and allows 
the surface metal to melt without forming a hole. Practice 
by slowly moving the flame along the surface until the 
puddle can be controlled without melting holes. Once that is 
mastered, practice on flanged joints by tacking and welding 
without filler rod. Then, try welding a butt joint using flux 
and filler rod. Practice and experience provides the visual 
indication of the melting aluminum so that a satisfactory 
weld can be performed. 

Aluminum gas welding is usually confined to material 
between 0.031-inch and 0.125-inch in thickness. The 
weldable aluminum alloys used in aircraft construction are 
1100, 3003, 4043, and 5052. Alloy numbers 6053, 6061, and 
6151 can also be welded, but since these alloys are in the 
heat-treated condition, welding should not be done unless 
the parts can be reheat treated.

Proper preparation prior to welding any metal is essential to 
produce a satisfactory weld. This preparation is especially 
critical during oxy-acetylene welding of aluminum. Select 
the proper torch tip for the thickness of metal being welded. 
Tip selection for aluminum is always one size larger than 
one would normally choose for the same thickness in a steel 
sheet. A rule of thumb: 3⁄4 metal thickness = tip orifice. 

Set the proper regulator pressure using the following method 
for oxy-acetylene welding of aluminum. This method has 
been used by all aircraft factories since World War II. Start 
by slowly opening the valve on the oxygen cylinder all the 
way until it stops to seat the upper packing. Now, barely 
crack open the acetylene cylinder valve until the needle on 
the gauge jumps up, then open one-quarter turn more. Check 
the regulators to ensure the adjusting screws are turned 
counterclockwise all the way out and loose. Now, open both 
torch valves wide open, about two full turns (varies with the 
torch model). Turn the acetylene regulator by adjusting the 
screw until the torch blows a light puff at a two-inch distance. 

Now, hold the torch away from the body and light it with the 
striker, adjusting the flame to a bright yellow bushy flame 
with the regulator screw. Add oxygen by slowly turning in 
the oxygen regulator screw to get a loud blue flame with a 
bright inner cone, perhaps a bit of the “fuel-rich” feather or 
carburizing secondary cone. By alternately turning in each of 
the torch valves a little bit, the flame setting can be lowered 
to what is needed to either tack or weld. 

Special safety eyewear must also be used to protect the 
welder and provide a clear view through the yellow-orange 
flare given off by the incandescing flux. Special purpose 
green-glass lens have been designed and patented especially 
for aluminum oxy-fuel welding by TM Technologies. These 
lenses cut the sodium orange flare completely and provide 
the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light, 
and impact. They meet safety standard ANSI Z87-1989 for 
a special-purpose lens.

Apply flux either to the material, the filler, or both if needed. 
The aluminum welding flux is a white powder mixed one 
part powder to two parts clean spring or mineral water. (Do 
not use distilled water.) Mix a paste that can be brushed on 
the metal. Heating the filler or the part with the torch before 
applying the flux helps the flux dry quickly and not pop off 
when the torch heat approaches. Proper safety precautions, 
such as eye protection, adequate ventilation, and avoiding 
the fumes are recommended.

The material to be welded must be free of oil or grease. It 
should be cleaned with a solvent; the best being denatured 
isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. A stainless toothbrush should 
be used to scrub off the invisible aluminum oxide film just 
prior to welding but after cleaning with alcohol. Always 
clean the filler rod or filler wire prior to use with alcohol 
and a clean cloth.

Make the best possible fit-up for joints to avoid large gaps 
and select the appropriate filler metal that is compatible with 
the base metal. The filler should not be a larger diameter than 
the pieces to be welded. [Figure 5-26]

Begin by tacking the pieces. The tacks should be applied 
1–11⁄2-inches apart. Tacks are done hot and fast by melting 
the edges of the metal together, if they are touching, or by 
adding filler to the melting edges when there is a gap. Tacking 
requires a hotter flame than welding. So, if the thickness of 
the metal being welded is known, set the length of the inner 
cone of the flame roughly three to four metal thicknesses in 
length for tacking. (Example: .063 aluminum sheet = 3⁄16–1⁄4 
inch inner cone.)

NOTE: When choosing between 5356, 5183, 5556, be aware that 
5356 is the weakest and 5556 is the strongest, with 5183 in between. 
Also, 4047 has more Si than 4043, therefore less sensitivity to
hot cracking, slightly higher weld shear strength, and less ductility.

Figure 5-26. Filler metal selection chart.

Once the edges are tacked, begin welding by either starting 
at the second tack and continuing on, or starting the weld one 
inch in from the end and then welding back to the edge of 
the sheet. Allow this initial skip-weld to chill and solidify. 
Then, begin to weld from the previous starting point and 
continue all the way to the end. Decrease the heat at the end 
of the seam to allow the accumulated heat to dissipate. The 
last inch or so is tricky and must be dabbed to prevent blow-
through. (Dabbing is the adding of filler metal in the molten 
pool while controlling the heat on the metal by raising and 
lowering the torch.)

Weld bead appearance, or making ringlets, is caused by the 
movement of the torch and dabbing the filler metal. If the 
torch and add filler metal is moved at the same time, the 

ringlet is more pronounced. A good weld has a bead that is 
not too proud and has penetration that is complete.

Immediately after welding, the flux must be cleaned by using 
hot (180 °F) water and the stainless steel brush, followed by 
liberal rinsing with fresh water. If only the filler was fluxed, 
the amount of cleanup is minimal. All flux residues must 
be removed from voids and pinholes. If any particular area 
is suspect to hidden flux, pass a neutral flame over it and a 
yellow-orange incandescence will betray hiding residues. 

Proper scrubbing with an etching solution and waiting no 
longer than 20 minutes to prime and seal avoids the lifting, 
peeling, or blistering of the finished topcoat. 

Magnesium Welding 
Gas welding of magnesium is very similar to welding 
aluminum using the same equipment. Joint design also 
follows similar practice to aluminum welding. Care must be 
taken to avoid designs that may trap flux after the welding 
is completed, with butt and edge welds being preferred. Of 
special interest is the high expansion rate of magnesium-
based alloys, and the special attention that must be given to 
avoid stresses being set up in the parts. Rigid fixtures should 
be avoided; use careful planning to eliminate distortion. 

In most cases, filler material should match the base material 
in alloy. When welding two different magnesium alloys 
together, the material manufacturer should be consulted 
for recommendations. Aluminum should never be welded 
to magnesium. As in aluminum welding, a flux is required 
to break down the surface oxides and ensure a sound weld. 
Fluxes sold specifically for the purpose of fusion welding 
magnesium are available in powder form and are mixed with 
water in the same manner as for aluminum welding. Use the 
minimum amount of flux necessary to reduce the corrosive 
effects and cleaning time required after the weld is finished. 
The sodium-flare reducing eye protection used for aluminum 
welding is of the same benefit on magnesium welding. 

Welding is done with a neutral flame setting using the same 
tip size for aluminum welding. The welding technique 
follows the same pattern as aluminum with the welding being 
completed in a single pass on sheet gauge material. Generally, 
the TIG process has replaced gas welding of magnesium 
due to the elimination of the corrosive flux and its inherent 
limitations on joint design.

Brazing and Soldering
Torch Brazing of Steel
The definition of joining two pieces of metal by brazing 
typically meant using brass or bronze as the filler metal. 


5-20

However, that definition has been expanded to include any 
metal joining process in which the bonding material is a 
nonferrous metal or alloy with a melting point higher than 
800 °F, but lower than that of the metals being joined. 

Brazing requires less heat than welding and can be used to 
join metals that may be damaged by high heat. However, 
because the strength of a brazed joint is not as great as that 
of a welded joint, brazing is not used for critical structural 
repairs on aircraft. Also, any metal part that is subjected to 
a sustained high temperature should not be brazed.

Brazing is applicable for joining a variety of metals, including 
brass, copper, bronze and nickel alloys, cast iron, malleable 
iron, wrought iron, galvanized iron and steel, carbon steel, 
and alloy steels. Brazing can also be used to join dissimilar 
metals, such as copper to steel or steel to cast iron. 

When metals are joined by brazing, the base metal parts are 
not melted. The brazing metal adheres to the base metal by 
molecular attraction and intergranular penetration; it does 
not fuse and amalgamate with them. 

In brazing, the edges of the pieces to be joined are usually 
beveled as in welding steel. The surrounding surfaces must be 
cleaned of dirt and rust. Parts to be brazed must be securely 
fastened together to prevent any relative movement. The 
strongest brazed joint is one in which the molten filler metal 
is drawn in by capillary action, requiring a close fit.

A brazing flux is necessary to obtain a good union between 
the base metal and the filler metal. It destroys the oxides and 
floats them to the surface, leaving a clean metal surface free 
from oxidation. A brazing rod can be purchased with a flux 
coating already applied, or any one of the numerous fluxes 
available on the market for specific application may be used. 
Most fluxes contain a mixture of borax and boric acid. 

The base metal should be preheated slowly with a neutral soft 
flame until it reaches the flowing temperature of the filler 
metal. If a filler rod that is not precoated with flux is used, 
heat about 2 inches of the rod end with the torch to a dark 
purple color and dip it into the flux. Enough flux adheres to 
the rod that it is unnecessary to spread it over the surface 
of the metal. Apply the flux-coated rod to the red-hot metal 
with a brushing motion, using the side of the rod; the brass 
flows freely into the steel. Keep the torch heat on the base 
metal to melt the filler rod. Do not melt the rod with the torch. 
Continue to add the rod as the brazing progresses, with a 
rhythmic dipping action so that the bead is built to a uniform 
width and height. The job should be completed rapidly and 
with the fewest possible passes of the rod and torch.

Notice that some metals are good conductors of heat and 
dissipate the heat more rapidly away from the joint. Other 
metals are poor conductors that tend to retain the heat and 
overheat readily. Controlling the temperature of the base 
metal is extremely important. The base metal must be hot 
enough for the brazing filler to flow, but never overheated 
to the filler boiling point. This causes the joint to be porous 
and brittle. 

The key to even heating of the joint area is to watch the 
appearance of the flux. The flux should change appearance 
uniformly when even heat is being applied. This is especially 
important when joining two metals of different mass or 
conductivity. 

The brazing rod melts when applied to the red-hot base 
metal and runs into the joint by capillary attraction. (Note 
that molten brazing filler metal tends to flow toward the 
area of higher temperature.) In a torch heated assembly, 
the outer metal surfaces are slightly hotter than the interior 
joint surfaces. The filler metal should be deposited directly 
adjacent to the joint. Where possible, the heat should be 
applied to the assembly on the side opposite to where the 
filler is applied because the filler metal tends to flow toward 
the source of greater heat.

After the brazing is complete, the assembly or component 
must be cleaned. Since most brazing fluxes are water soluble, 
a hot water rinse (120 °F or hotter) and a wire brush remove 
the flux. If the flux was overheated during the brazing 
process, it usually turns green or black. In this case, the flux 
needs to be removed with a mild acid solution recommended 
by the manufacturer of the flux in use. 
 
Torch Brazing of Aluminum
Torch brazing of aluminum is done using similar methods 
as brazing of other materials. The brazing material itself is 
an aluminum/silicon alloy having a slightly lower melting 
temperature than the base material. Aluminum brazing occurs 
at temperatures over 875 °F, but below the melting point of 
the parent metal. This is performed with a specific aluminum 
brazing flux. Brazing is best suited to joint configurations that 
have large surface areas in contact, such as the lap, or for fitting 
fuel tank bungs and fittings. Either acetylene or hydrogen may 
be used as fuel gas, both being used for production work for 
many years. Using eye protection that reduces the sodium 
flare, such as the TM2000 lens, is recommended. 

When using acetylene, the tip size is usually the same, or one 
size smaller than that used for welding of aluminum. A 1–2X 
reducing flame is used to form a slightly cooler flame, and the 
torch is held back at a greater distance using the outer envelope 


5-21

as the heat source rather than the inner cone. Prepare the flux 
and apply in the same manner as the aluminum welding flux, 
fluxing both the base metal and filler material. Heat the parts 
with the outer envelope of the flame, watching for the flux to 
begin to liquefy; the filler may be applied at that point. The 
filler should flow easily. If the part gets overheated, the flux 
turns brown or grey. If this happens, reclean and re-flux the 
part before continuing. Brazing is more easily accomplished 
on 1100, 3003, and 6061 aluminum alloys. 5052 alloy is more 
difficult; proper cleaning and practice are vital. There are 
brazing products sold that have the flux contained in hollow 
spaces in the filler metal itself, which typically work only on 
1100, 3003, and 6061 alloys as the flux is not strong enough 
for use on 5052. Cleaning after brazing is accomplished the 
same as with oxy-fuel welding of aluminum, using hot water 
and a clean stainless brush. The flux is corrosive, so every 
effort should be made to remove it thoroughly and quickly 
after the brazing is completed.
  
Soldering
Soft solder is chiefly used to join copper and brass where a 
leak proof joint is desired, and sometimes for fitting joints 
to promote rigidity and prevent corrosion. Soft soldering is 
generally performed only in minor repair jobs. Soft solder 
is also used to join electrical connections. It forms a strong 
union with low electrical resistance. 

Soft soldering does not require the heat of an oxy-fuel 
gas torch and can be performed using a small propane or 
MAPP® torch, an electrical soldering iron, or in some cases, a 
soldering copper, that is heated by an outside source, such as 
an oven or torch. The soft solders are chiefly alloys of tin and 
lead. The percentages of tin and lead vary considerably in the 
various solders with a corresponding change in their melting 
points ranging from 293 °F to 592 °F. Half-and-half (50/50) 
is the most common general-purpose solder. It contains equal 
portions of tin and lead and melts at approximately 360 °F. 

To get the best results for heat transfer when using an electrical 
soldering iron or a soldering copper, the tip must be clean and 
have a layer of solder on it. This is usually referred to as being 
tinned. The hot iron or copper should be fluxed and the solder 
wiped across the tip to form a bright, thin layer of solder.

Flux is used with soft solder for the same reasons as with 
brazing. It cleans the surface area to be joined and promotes 
the flow by capillary action into the joint. Most fluxes should 
be cleaned away after the job is completed because they cause 
corrosion. Electrical connections should be soldered only 
with soft solder containing rosin. Rosin does not corrode the 
electrical connection. 

Aluminum Soldering
The soldering of aluminum is much like the soldering of 
other metals. The use of special aluminum solders is required, 
along with the necessary flux. Aluminum soldering occurs at 
temperatures below 875 °F. Soldering can be accomplished 
using the oxy-acetylene, oxy-hydrogen, or even an air-
propane torch setup. A neutral flame is used in the case of 
either oxy-acetylene or oxy-hydrogen. Depending on the 
solder and flux type, most common aluminum alloys can be 
soldered. Being of lower melting temperature, a tip one or 
two sizes smaller than required for welding is used, along 
with a soft flame setting. 

Joint configurations for aluminum soldering follow the same 
guidelines as any other base material. Lap joints are preferred 
to tee or butt joints due to the larger surface contact area. 
However parts, such as heat exchanger tubes, are a common 
exception to this.

Normally, the parts are cleaned as for welding or brazing, and 
the flux is applied according to manufacturer’s instructions. 
The parts are evenly heated with the outer envelope of the 
flame to avoid overheating the flux, and the solder is applied 
in a fashion similar to that for other base metals. Cleaning 
after soldering may not be required to prevent oxidation 
because some fluxes are not corrosive. However, it is always 
advisable to remove all flux residues after soldering. 

Aluminum soldering is commonly used in such applications 
as the repair of heat exchanger or radiator cores originally 
using a soldered joint. It is not, however, to be used as a direct 
replacement repair for brazing or welding.
  
Silver Soldering
The principle use of silver solder in aircraft work is in the 
fabrication of high-pressure oxygen lines and other parts that 
must withstand vibration and high temperatures.

Silver solder is used extensively to join copper and its alloys, 
nickel and silver, as well as various combinations of these 
metals and thin steel parts. Silver soldering produces joints 
of higher strength than those produced by other brazing 
processes.

Flux must be used in all silver soldering operations to ensure 
the base metal is chemically clean. The flux removes the film 
of oxide from the base metal and allows the silver solder to 
adhere to it.

Figure 5-27. Silver solder joints.

Figure 5-28. Effects of sharp and blunt electrodes.

All silver solder joints must be physically, as well as 
chemically, clean. The joint must be free of dirt, grease, oil, 
and/or paint. After removing the dirt, grease, etc., any oxide 
(rust and/or corrosion) should be removed by grinding or 
filing the piece until bright metal can be seen. During the 
soldering operation, the flux continues to keep the oxide away 
from the metal and aid in the flow of the solder.

The three recommended types of joint for silver soldering 
are lap, flanged, and edge. With these, the metal is formed 
to furnish a seam wider than the base metal thickness and 
provide the type of joint that holds up under all types of 
loads. [Figure 5-27]

The oxy-acetylene flame for silver soldering should be a 
soft neutral or slightly reducing flame. That is, a flame with 
a slight excess of acetylene. During both preheating and 
application of the solder, the tip of the inner cone of the 
flame should be held about 1⁄2-inch from the work. The flame 
should be kept moving so that the metal does not overheat.

When both parts of the base metal are at the correct 
temperature, the flux flows and solder can be applied 
directly adjacent to the edge of the seam. It is necessary to 
simultaneously direct the flame over the seam and keep it 
moving so that the base metal remains at an even temperature. 

Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (TIG Welding)
The TIG process as it is known today is a combination of 
the work done by General Electric in the 1920s to develop 
the basic process, the work done by Northrop in the 1940s 
to develop the torch itself, and the use of helium-shielding 
gas and a tungsten electrode. The process was developed for 
welding magnesium in the Northrop XP-56 flying wing to 
eliminate the corrosion and porosity issues with the atomic 
hydrogen process they had been using with a boron flux. It 
was not readily used on other materials until the late 1950s 
when it found merit in welding space-age super alloys. It was 
also later used on other metals, such as aluminum and steel, 
to a much greater degree. 

Modern TIG welding machines are offered in DC, AC, or 
with AC/DC configurations, and use either transformer or 
inverter-based technology. Typically, a machine capable of 
AC output is required for aluminum. The TIG torch itself has 

changed little since the first Northrop patent. TIG welding 
is similar to oxy-fuel welding in that the heat source (torch) 
is manipulated with one hand, and the filler, if used, is 
manipulated with the other. A distinct difference is to control 
the heat input to the metal. The heat control may be preset 
and fixed by a machine setting or variable by use of a foot 
pedal or torch-mounted control.

Several types of tungsten electrode are used with the TIG 
welder. Thoriated and zirconiated electrodes have better 
electron emission characteristics than pure tungsten, making 
them more suitable for DC operations on transformer-based 
machines, or either AC or DC with the newer inverter-based 
machines. Pure tungsten provides a better current balance 
with AC welding with a transformer based machine, which 
is advantageous when welding aluminum and magnesium. 
The equipment manufacturers’ suggestions for tungsten type 
and form should be followed as this is an ever changing part 
of the TIG technology.

The shape of the electrode used in the TIG welding torch 
is an important factor in the quality and penetration of the 
weld. The tip of the electrode should be shaped on a dedicated 
grinding stone or a special-purpose tungsten grinder to avoid 
contaminating the electrode. The grinding should be done 
longitudinally, not radially, with the direction of stone travel 
away from the tip. Figure 5-28 shows the effects of a sharp 
versus blunt electrode with transformer-based machines. 

When in doubt, consult the machine manufacturer for the 
latest up-to-date suggestions on tungsten preparation or if 
problems arise.

The general guidelines for weld quality, joint fit prior to 
welding, jigging, and controlling warp all apply to this 
process in the same regard as any other welding method. Of 
particular note are the additional process steps that sometimes 
must be taken to perform a quality weld; these are dealt within 
their appropriate sections.


5-23

TIG Welding 4130 Steel Tubing  
Welding 4130 with TIG is not much different than welding 
other steels as far as technique is concerned. The following 
information generally addresses material under 0.120- 
inch thick.

Clean the steel of any oil or grease and use a stainless steel 
wire brush to clean the work piece prior to welding. This is 
to prevent porosity and hydrogen embrittlement during the 
welding process. The TIG process is highly susceptible to 
these problems, much more so than oxy-acetylene welding, 
so care must be taken to ensure all oils and paint are removed 
from all surfaces of the parts to be welded.

Use a TIG welder with high-frequency starting to eliminate 
arc strikes. Do not weld where there is any breeze or draft; 
the welds should be allowed to cool slowly. Preheating 
is not necessary for tubing of less than 0.120-inch wall 
thickness; however, post-weld tempering (stress relieving) is 
still recommended to prevent the possible brittleness of the 
area surrounding the weld due to the untempered martensite 
formations caused by the rapid cooling of the weld inherent 
to the TIG process.

If you use 4130 filler rod, preheat the work before welding 
and heat treat afterward to avoid cracking. In a critical 
situation such as this, engineering should be done to 
determine preheat and post-weld heat treatment needed for 
the particular application.

Weld at a slower speed, make sufficiently large fillets, and 
make them flat or slightly convex, not concave. After the 
welding is complete, allow the weldment to cool to room 
temperature. Using an oxy-acetylene torch set to a neutral 
flame, heat the entire weldment evenly to 1,100 °F–1,200 °F; 
hold this temperature for about 45 minutes per inch of metal 
thickness. The temperature is generally accepted to be a dull 
red in ambient lighting. Note that for most tubing sections, the 
temperature needs to be held for only a minute or two. This 
process is found in most materials engineering handbooks 
written by The Materials Information Society (ASM) and 
other engineering sources. When working on a critical 
component, seek engineering help if there is any doubt. 
  
TIG Welding Stainless Steel
Stainless steels, or more precisely, corrosion-resisting steels, 
are a family of iron-based metals that contain chromium 
in amounts ranging from 10 percent to about 30 percent. 
Nickel is added to some of the stainless steels, which 
reduces the thermal conductivity and decreases the electrical 
conductivity. The chromium-nickel steels belong in the AISI 
300 series of stainless steels. They are nonmagnetic and have 
austenitic microstructure. These steels are used extensively 

in aircraft in which strength or resistance to corrosion at high 
temperature is required. 

All of the austenitic stainless steels are weldable with most 
welding processes, with the exception of AISI 303, which 
contains high sulfur, and AISI 303Se, which contains 
selenium to improve its machinability. 

The austenitic stainless steels are slightly more difficult 
to weld than mild-carbon steel. They have lower melting 
temperatures, and a lower coefficient of thermal conductivity, 
so welding current can be lower. This helps on thinner 
materials because these stainless steels have a higher 
coefficient of thermal expansion, requiring special 
precautions and procedures to be used to reduce warping and 
distortion. Any of the distortion-reducing techniques, such as 
skip welding or back-step welding, should be used. Fixtures 
and/or jigs should be used where possible. Tack welds should 
be applied twice as often as normal. 

The selection of the filler metal alloy for welding the stainless 
steel is based on the composition of the base metal. Filler 
metal alloys for welding austenitic type stainless include 
AISI No. 309, 310, 316, 317, and 347. It is possible to weld 
several different stainless base metals with the same filler 
metal alloy. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. 

Clean the base metal just prior to welding to prevent the 
formation of oxides. Clean the surface and joint edges with 
a nonchlorinated solvent, and brush with a stainless steel 
wire brush to remove the oxides. Clean the filler material in 
the same manner. 

To form a weld bead, move the torch along the joint at 
a steady speed using the forehand method. Dip the filler 
metal into the center of the weld puddle to ensure adequate 
shielding from the gas.

The base metal needs protection during the welding process 
by either an inert gas shield, or a backing flux, on both sides 
of the weld. Back purging uses a separate supply of shielding 
gas to purge the backside of the weld of any ambient air. 
Normally, this requires sealing off the tubular structures or 
using other various forms of shields and tapes to contain 
the shielding gas. A special flux may also be used on the 
inside of tubular structures in place of a back purge. This is 
especially advantageous with exhaust system repairs in which 
sealing off the entire system is time consuming. The flux is 
the same as is used for the oxy-acetylene welding process 
on stainless materials.


5-24

TIG Welding Aluminum
TIG welding of aluminum uses similar techniques and filler 
materials as oxy-fuel welding. Consult with the particular 
welding machine manufacturer for recommendations on 
tungsten type and size, as well as basic machine settings 
for a  particular weldment because this varies with specific 
machine types. Typically, the machine is set to an AC output 
waveform because it causes a cleaning action that breaks 
up surface oxides. Argon or helium shielding gas may be 
used, but argon is preferred because it uses less by volume 
than helium. Argon is a heavier gas than helium, providing 
better cover, and it provides a better cleaning action when 
welding aluminum. 

Filler metal selection is the same as used with the oxy-fuel 
process; however, the use of a flux is not needed as the 
shielding gas prevents the formation of aluminum oxide on 
the surface of the weld pool, and the AC waveform breaks 
up any oxides already on the material. Cleaning of the base 
metal and filler follows the same guidelines as for oxy-fuel 
welding. When welding tanks of any kind, it is a good practice 
to back-purge the inside of the tank with a shielding gas. This 
promotes a sound weld with a smooth inner bead profile that 
can help lessen pinhole leaks and future fatigue failures.

Welding is done with similar torch and filler metal angles as 
in oxy-fuel welding. The tip on the tungsten is held a short 
distance (1⁄16 –1⁄8-inch) from the surface of the material, taking 
care not to ever let the molten pool contact the tungsten and 
contaminate it. Contamination of the tungsten must be dealt 
with by removal of the aluminum from the tungsten and re-
grinding the tip to the factory recommended profile. 

TIG Welding Magnesium
Magnesium alloys can be welded successfully using the 
same type joints and preparation that are used for steel or 
aluminum. However, because of its high thermal conductivity 
and coefficient of thermal expansion, which combine to cause 
severe stresses, distortion, and cracking, extra precautions 
must be taken. Parts must be clamped in a fixture or jig. 
Smaller welding beads, faster welding speed, and the use 
of a lower melting point and lower shrinkage filler rods are 
recommended. 

DC, both straight or reverse polarity, and AC, with 
superimposed high frequency for arc stabilization, are 
commonly used for welding magnesium. DC reverse polarity 
provides better cleaning action of the metal and is preferred 
for manual welding operations. 

AC power sources should be equipped with a primary 
contactor operated by a control switch on the torch or a foot 
control for starting or stopping the arc. Otherwise, the arcing 

that occurs while the electrode approaches or draws away 
from the work piece may result in burned spots on the work. 

Argon is the most common used shielding gas for manual 
welding operations. Helium is the preferred gas for automated 
welding because it produces a more stable arc than argon and 
permits the use of slightly longer arc lengths. Zirconiated, 
thoriated, and pure tungsten electrodes are used for TIG 
welding magnesium alloys.

The welding technique for magnesium is similar to that used 
for other non-ferrous metals. The arc should be maintained 
at about 5⁄16-inch. Tack welds should be used to maintain fit 
and prevent distortion. To prevent weld cracking, weld from 
the middle of a joint towards the end, and use starting and 
run off plates to start and end the weld. Minimize the number 
of stops during welding. After a stop, the weld should be 
restarted about ½-inch from the end of the previous weld. 
When possible, make the weld in one uninterrupted pass. 
    
TIG Welding Titanium
The techniques for welding titanium are similar to those 
required for nickel-based alloys and stainless steels. To 
produce a satisfactory weld, emphasis is placed on the 
surface cleanliness and the use of inert gas to shield the 
weld area. A clean environment is one of the requirements 
to weld titanium.

TIG welding of titanium is performed using DC straight 
polarity. A water-cooled torch, equipped with a ¾-inch 
ceramic cup and a gas lens, is recommended. The gas lens 
provides a uniform, nonturbulent inert gas flow. Thoriated 
tungsten electrodes are recommended for TIG welding of 
titanium. The smallest diameter electrode that can carry 
the required current should be used. A remote contactor 
controlled by the operator should be employed to allow the 
arc to be broken without removing the torch from the cooling 
weld metal, allowing the shielding gas to cover the weld until 
the temperature drops.

Most titanium welding is performed in an open fabrication 
shop. Chamber welding is still in use on a limited basis, but 
field welding is common. A separate area should be set aside 
and isolated from any dirt producing operations, such as 
grinding or painting. Additionally, the welding area should 
be free of air drafts and the humidity should be controlled. 

Molten titanium weld metal must be totally shielded from 
contamination by air. Molten titanium reacts readily with 
oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen; exposure to these elements 
in air or in surface contaminants during welding can adversely 
affect titanium weld properties and cause weld embrittlement. 
Argon is preferred for manual welding because of better 


5-25

arc stability characteristics. Helium is used in automated 
welding and when heavier base metals or deeper penetration 
is required. 

Care must be taken to ensure that the heat affected zones 
and the root side of the titanium welds are shielded until 
the weld metal temperature drops below 800 °F. This can 
be accomplished using shielding gas in three separate gas 
streams during welding.

1. The first shielding of the molten puddle and adjacent 
surfaces is provided by the flow of gas through the 
torch. Manufacturer recommendations should be 
followed for electrodes, tip grinding, cup size, and 
gas flow rates.

2. The secondary, or trailing, shield of gas protects 
the solidified weld metal and the heat affected zone 
until the temperature drops. Trailing shields are 
custom-made to fit a specific torch and a particular  
welding operation.

3. The third, or backup, flow is provided by a shielding 
device that can take many forms. On straight seam 
welds, it may be a grooved copper backing bar 
clamped behind the seam allowing the gas flow in the 
groove and serving as a heat sink. Irregular areas may 
be enclosed with aluminum tents taped to the backside 
of welds and purged with the inert gas. 

Titanium weld joints are similar to those employed with 
other metals. Before welding, the weld joint surfaces must 
be cleaned and remain free of any contamination during the 
welding operation. Detergent cleaners and nonchlorinated 
cleaners, such as denatured isopropyl alcohol, may be used. 
The same requirements apply to the filler rod, it too must 
be cleaned and free of all contaminates. Welding gloves, 
especially the one holding the filler, must be contaminate free. 

A good indication and measure of weld quality for titanium 
is the weld color. A bright silver weld indicates that the 
shielding is satisfactory and the heat affected zone and 
backup was properly purged until weld temperatures 
dropped. Straw-colored films indicate slight contamination, 
unlikely to affect mechanical properties; dark blue films or 
white powdery oxide on the weld would indicate a seriously 
deficient purge. A weld in that condition must be completely 
removed and rewelded. 

Arc Welding Procedures, Techniques, and 
Welding Safety Equipment
Arc welding, also referred to as stick welding, has been 
performed successfully on almost all types of metals. This 
section addresses the procedures as they may apply to 
fusion welding of steel plate and provides the basic steps 

and procedures required to produce an acceptable arc 
weld. Additional instruction and information pertaining 
to arc welding of other metals can be obtained from 
training institutions and the various manufacturers of the  
welding equipment. 
 
The first step in preparing to arc weld is to make certain that 
the necessary equipment is available and that the welding 
machine is properly connected and in good working order. 
Particular attention should be given to the ground connection, 
since a poor connection results in a fluctuating arc, that is 
difficult to control.

When using a shielded electrode, the bare end of the electrode 
should be clamped in its holder at a 90° angle to the jaws. 
(Some holders allow the electrode to be inserted at a 45° 
angle when needed for various welding positions.) 

Before starting to weld, the following typical list of items 
should be checked:

• Is the proper personal safety equipment being used, 
including a welding helmet, welding gloves, protective 
clothing, and footwear; if not, in an adequately 
ventilated area, appropriate breathing equipment?

• Has the ground connection been properly made to the 
work piece and is it making a good connection?

• Has the proper type and size electrode been selected 
for the job?

• Is the electrode properly secured in the holder?

• Does the polarity of the machine coincide with that 
of the electrode?

• Is the machine in good working order and is it adjusted 
to provide the necessary current for the job?

The welding arc is established by touching the base metal 
plate with the electrode and immediately withdrawing it a 
short distance. At the instant the electrode touches the plate, 
a rush of current flows through the point of contact. As the 
electrode is withdrawn, an electric arc is formed, melting a 
spot on the plate and at the end of the electrode. 

Correctly striking an arc takes practice. The main difficulty 
in confronting a beginner in striking the arc is sticking the 
electrode to the work. If the electrode is not withdrawn 
promptly upon contact with the metal, the high amperage 
flows through the electrode causing it to stick or freeze to 
the plate and practically short circuits the welding machine. 
A quick roll of the wrist, either right or left, usually breaks 
the electrode loose from the work piece. If that does not 
work, quickly unclamp the holder from the electrode, and 
turn off the machine. A small chisel and hammer frees the

electrode from the metal so it can be regripped in the holder. 
The welding machine can then be turned back on. 

There are two essentially similar methods of striking the arc. 
One is the touch or tapping method. When using this method, 
the electrode should be held in a vertical position and lowered 
until it is an inch or so above the point where the arc is to 
be struck. Then, the electrode is lightly tapped on the work 
piece and immediately lifted to form an arc approximately 
¼-inch in length. [Figure 5-29]

The second (and usually easier to master) is a scratch or 
sweeping method. To strike the arc by the scratch method, the 
electrode is held just above the plate at an angle of 20°–25°. 
The arc should be struck by sweeping the electrode with a 
wrist motion and lightly scratching the plate. The electrode 
is then lifted immediately to form an arc. [Figure 5-30]

Either method takes some practice, but with time and 
experience, it becomes easy. The key is to raise the electrode 
quickly, but only about ¼-inch from the base or the arc is 
lost. If it is raised too slowly, the electrode sticks to the plate. 
 
To form a uniform bead, the electrode must be moved along 
the plate at a constant speed in addition to the downward 

feed of the electrode. If the rate of advance is too slow, a 
wide overlapping bead forms with no fusion at the edges. If 
the rate is too fast, the bead is too narrow and has little or no 
fusion at the plate.

The proper length of the arc cannot be judged by looking at it. 
Instead, depend on the sound that the short arc makes. This is a 
sharp cracking sound, and it should be heard during the time the 
arc is being moved down to and along the surface of the plate.

A good weld bead on a flat plate should have the following 
characteristics:

• Little or no splatter on the surface of the plate.

• An arc crater in the bead of approximately 1⁄16-inch 
when the arc has been broken. 

• The bead should be built up slightly, without metal 
overlap at the top surface.

• The bead should have a good penetration of 
approximately 1⁄16-inch into the base metal.

Figure 5-31 provides examples of operator’s technique and 
welding machine settings.

When advancing the electrode, it should be held at an angle 
of about 20° to 25° in the direction of travel moving away 
from the finished bead. [Figure 5-32]

If the arc is broken during the welding of a bead and the 
electrode is removed quickly, a crater is formed at the point 
where the arc ends. This shows the depth of penetration 
or fusion that the weld is getting. The crater is formed by 
the pressure of the gases from the electrode tip forcing the 
weld metal toward the edges of the crater. If the electrode is 
removed slowly, the crater is filled. 

If you need to restart an arc of an interrupted bead, start 
just ahead of the crater of the previous weld bead, as shown 
in position 1, Figure 5-33. Then, the electrode should be 
returned to the back edge of the crater (step 2). From this 
point, the weld may be continued by welding right through the 
crater and down the line of weld as originally planned (step 3). 

Once a bead has been formed, every particle of slag must 
be removed from the area of the crater before restarting the 
arc. This is accomplished with a pick hammer and wire brush 
and prevents the slag from becoming trapped in the weld. 

Multiple Pass Welding
Groove and fillet welds in heavy metals often require the 
deposit of a number of beads to complete a weld. It is 
important that the beads be deposited in a predetermined 
sequence to produce the soundest welds with the best

proportions. The number of beads is determined by the 
thickness of the metal being welded.

Plates from 1⁄8-inch to ¼-inch can be welded in one pass, but 
they should be tacked at intervals to keep them aligned. Any 
weld on a plate thicker than ¼-inch should have the edges 
beveled and multiple passes.

The sequence of the bead deposits is determined by the 
kind of joint and the position of the metal. All slag must be 
removed from each bead before another bead is deposited. 

Typical multiple-pass groove welding of butt joints is shown 
in Figure 5-34.

Techniques of Position Welding
Each time the position of a welded joint or the type of joint 
is changed, it may be necessary to change any one or a 
combination of the following:

• Current value

• Electrode

• Polarity

• Arc length

• Welding technique

Current values are determined by the electrode size, as well 
as the welding position. Electrode size is governed by the 
thickness of the metal and the joint preparation. The electrode 
type is determined by the welding position. Manufacturers 
specify the polarity to be used with each electrode. Arc length

Since it is impractical to cite every possible variation 
occasioned by different welding conditions, only the 
information necessary for the commonly used positions and 
welds is discussed here.

Flat Position Welding
There are four types of welds commonly used in flat position 
welding: bead, groove, fillet, and lap joint. Each type is 
discussed separately in the following paragraphs.

Bead Weld
The bead weld utilizes the same technique that is used when 
depositing a bead on a flat metal surface. [Figure 5-35] The 
only difference is that the deposited bead is at the butt joint 
of two steel plates, fusing them together. Square butt joints 
may be welded in one or multiple passes. If the thickness of 
the metal is such that complete fusion cannot be obtained 
by welding from one side, the joint must be welded from 
both sides. Most joints should first be tack-welded to ensure 
alignment and reduce warping. 

Groove Weld
Groove welding may be performed on a butt joint or an 
outside corner joint. Groove welds are made on butt joints 
where the metal to be welded is ¼-inch or more in thickness. 
The butt joint can be prepared using either a single or double 
groove depending on the thickness of the plate. The number 
of passes required to complete a weld is determined by 
the thickness of the metal being welded and the size of the 
electrode being used. 

Any groove weld made in more than one pass must have 
the slag, spatter, and oxide carefully removed from all

previous weld deposits before welding over them. Some of 
the common types of groove welds performed on butt joints 
in the flat position are shown in Figure 5-36.

Fillet Weld
Fillet welds are used to make tee and lap joints. The electrode 
should be held at an angle of 45° to the plate surface. The 
electrode should be tilted at an angle of about 15° in the 
direction of welding. Thin plates should be welded with little 
or no weaving motion of the electrode and the weld is made 
in one pass. Fillet welding of thicker plates may require two 
or more passes using a semicircular weaving motion of the 
electrode. [Figure 5-37]

Lap Joint Weld
The procedure for making fillet weld in a lap joint is similar 
to that used in the tee joint. The electrode is held at about a 
30° angle to the vertical and tilted to an angle of about 15° 
in the direction of welding when joining plates of the same 
thickness. [Figure 5-38]

Vertical Position Welding 
Vertical positing welding includes any weld applied to a 
surface inclined more than 45° from the horizontal. Welding 
in the vertical position is more difficult than welding in the 

flat position because of the force of gravity. The molten metal 
has the tendency to run down. To control the flow of molten 
metal, the voltage and current adjustments of the welding 
machine must be correct. 

The current setting, or amperage, is less for welding in 
the vertical position than for welding in the flat position 
for similar size electrodes. Additionally, the current used 
for welding upward should be set slightly higher than the 
current used for welding downward on the same work piece. 
When welding up, hold the electrode 90° to the vertical, and 
weld moving the bead upward. Focus on welding the sides 
of the joint and the middle takes care of itself. In welding 
downward, with the hand below the arc and the electrode 
tilted about 15° upward, the weld should move downward. 

Overhead Position Welding
Overhead position welding is one of the most difficult in 
welding since a very short arc must be constantly maintained 
to control the molten metal. The force of gravity tends to 
cause the molten metal to drop down or sag from the plate, 
so it is important that protective clothing and head gear be 
worn at all times when performing overhead welding. 

For bead welds in an overhead position, the electrode should 
be held at an angle of 90° to the base metal. In some cases 
where it is desirable to observe the arc and the crater of the 
weld, the electrode may be held at an angle of 15° in the 
direction of welding. 

When making fillet welds on overhead tee or lap joints, a 
short arc should be held, and there should be no weaving of 
the electrode. The arc motion should be controlled to secure 
good penetration to the root of the weld and good fusion to the 
plates. If the molten metal becomes too fluid and tends to sag, 
the electrode should be whipped away quickly from the center 
ahead of the weld to lengthen the arc and allow the metal to 
solidify. The electrode should then be returned immediately 
to the crater of the weld and the welding continued.

Anyone learning or engaged in arc welding should always 
have a good view of the weld puddle. Otherwise there is no 
way to ensure that the welding is in the joint and keeping 
the arc on the leading edge of the puddle. For the best view, 
the welder should keep their head off to the side and out of 
the fumes so they can see the puddle. 
 
Expansion and Contraction of Metals
The expansion and contraction of metal is a factor taken into 
consideration during the design and manufacturing of all 
aircraft. It is equally important to recognize and allow for the 
dimensional changes and metal stress that may occur during 
any welding process.


5-30

Butt joint Lap joint Tee joint

Corner joint Edge joint

Figure 5-39. Allowance for a straight butt weld when joining steel 
sheets.

Figure 5-40. Basic joints.

Heat causes metals to expand; cooling causes them to 
contract. Therefore, uneven heating causes uneven expansion, 
and uneven cooling causes uneven contraction. Under such 
conditions, stresses are set up within the metal. These forces 
must be relieved, and unless precautions are taken, warping 
or buckling of the metal takes place. Likewise, on cooling, if 
nothing is done to take up the stress set up by the contraction 
forces, further warping may result; or if the metal is too heavy 
to permit this change in shape, the stresses remain within 
the metal itself.

The coefficient of linear expansion of a metal is the amount 
in inches that a one inch piece of metal expands when its 
temperature is raised 1 °F. The amount that a piece of metal 
expands when heat is applied is found by multiplying the 
coefficient of linear expansion by the temperature rise and 
multiplying that product by the length of the metal in inches.

Expansion and contraction have a tendency to buckle and warp 
thin sheet metal 1⁄8-inch or thinner. This is the result of having 
a large surface area that spreads heat rapidly and dissipates it 
soon after the source of heat is removed. The most effective 
method of alleviating this situation is to remove the heat 
from the metal near the weld, preventing it from spreading 
across the whole surface area. This can be done by placing 
heavy pieces of metal, known as chill bars, on either side of 
the weld; to absorb the heat and prevent it from spreading. 
Copper is most often used for chill bars because of its ability to 
absorb heat readily. Welding fixtures sometimes use this same 
principle to remove heat from the base metal. Expansion can 
also be controlled by tack welding at intervals along the joint.

The effect of welding a seam longer than 10 or 12 inches is 
to draw the seam together as the weld progresses. If the edges 
of the seam are placed in contact with each other throughout 
their length before welding starts, the far ends of the seam 
actually overlap before the weld is completed. This tendency 
can be overcome by setting the pieces to be welded with the 
seam spaced correctly at one end and increasing the space 
at the opposite end. [Figure 5-39]

The amount of space allowed depends on the type of material, 
the thickness of the material, the welding process being used, 
and the shape and size of the pieces to be welded. Instruction 
and/or welding experience dictates the space needed to 
produce a stress-free joint.

The weld is started at the correctly spaced end and proceeds 
toward the end that has the increased gap. As the seam is 
welded, the space closes and should provide the correct gap 
at the point of welding. Sheet metal under 1⁄16-inch can be 
handled by flanging the edges, tack welding at intervals, and 
then by welding between the tacks.

There are fewer tendencies for plate stock over 1⁄8-inch to 
warp and buckle when welded because the greater thickness 
limits the heat to a narrow area and dissipates it before it 
travels far on the plate.

Preheating the metal before welding is another method 
of controlling expansion and contraction. Preheating is 
especially important when welding tubular structures and 
castings. Great stress can be set up in tubular welds by 
contraction. When welding two members of a tee joint, one 
tube tends to draw up because of the uneven contraction. If 
the metal is preheated before the welding operation begins, 
contraction still takes place in the weld, but the accompanying 
contraction in the rest of the structure is at almost the same 
rate, and internal stress is reduced.

used for metals from 1⁄16-inch to 1⁄8-inch in thickness. A filler 
rod is used when making this joint to obtain a strong weld. 

The flanged butt joint can be used in welding thin sheets, 1⁄16-
inch or less. The edges are prepared for welding by turning 
up a flange equal to the thickness of the metal. This type of 
joint is usually made without the use of a filler rod.

If the metal is thicker than 1⁄8-inch, it may be necessary to 
bevel the edges so that the heat from the torch can completely 
penetrate the metal. These bevels may be either single 
or double-bevel type or single or double-V type. A filler 
rod is used to add strength and reinforcement to the weld. 
[Figure 5-41]

Repair of cracks by welding may be considered just another 
type of butt joint. The crack should be stop drilled at either 
end and then welded like a plain butt joint using filler rod. 
In most cases, the welding of the crack does not constitute 
a complete repair and some form of reinforcement is still 
required, as described in following sections. 
 
Tee Joints
A tee joint is formed when the edge or end of one piece is 
welded to the surface of another. [Figure 5-42] These joints 
are quite common in aircraft construction, particularly in 
tubular structures. The plain tee joint is suitable for most 
thicknesses of metal used in aircraft, but heavier thicknesses 
require the vertical member to be either single or double-
beveled to permit the heat to penetrate deeply enough. The 

dark areas in Figure 5-42 show the depth of heat penetration 
and fusion required. It is a good practice to leave a gap 
between the parts, about equal to the metal thickness to aid 
full penetration of the weld. This is common when welding 
from only one side with tubing clusters. Tight fitment of the 
parts prior to welding does not provide for a proper weldment 
unless full penetration is secured, and this is much more 
difficult with a gapless fitment. 

Edge Joints
An edge joint is used when two pieces of sheet metal must be 
fastened together and load stresses are not important. Edge 
joints are usually made by bending the edges of one or both 
parts upward, placing the two ends parallel to each other, 
and welding along the outside of the seam formed by the two 
joined edges. The joint shown in Figure 5-43A requires no 
filler rod since the edges can be melted down to fill the seam. 
The joint shown in Figure 5-43B, being thicker material, 
must be beveled for heat penetration; filler rod is added for 
reinforcement.

Corner Joints
A corner joint is made when two pieces of metal are 
brought together so that their edges form a corner of a 
box or enclosure. [Figure 5-44] The corner joint shown in 
Figure 5-44A requires no filler rod, since the edges fuse 
to make the weld. It is used where the load stress is not 
important. The type shown in Figure 5-44B is used on heavier

metals, and filler rod is added for roundness and strength. 
If a higher stress is to be placed on the corner, the inside is 
reinforced with another weld bead. [Figure 5-44C]

Lap Joints
The lap joint is seldom used in aircraft structures when 
welding with oxy-acetylene, but is commonly used and joined 
by spot welding. The single lap joint has very little resistance 
to bending, and cannot withstand the shearing stress to which 
the weld may be subjected under tension or compression 
loads. The double lap joint offers more strength, but requires 
twice the amount of welding required on the simpler, more 
efficient butt weld. [Figure 5-45]

Repair of Steel Tubing Aircraft Structure 
by Welding   
Dents at a Cluster Weld
Dents at a cluster weld can be repaired by welding a formed 
steel patch plate over the dented area and surrounding 
tubes. Remove any existing finish on the damaged area and 
thoroughly clean prior to welding.

To prepare the patch plate, cut a section from a steel sheet of 
the same material and thickness as the heaviest tube damaged. 

Fashion the reinforcement plate so that the fingers extend 
over the tubes a minimum of 1½ times the respective tube 
diameter. The plate may be cut and formed prior to welding 
or cut and tack welded to the cluster, then heated and formed 
around the joint to produce a snug smooth contour. Apply 
sufficient heat to the plate while forming so there is a gap of 
no more than 1⁄16-inch from the contour of the joint to the plate. 

In this operation, avoid unnecessary heating and exercise care 
to prevent damage at the point of the angle formed by any 
two adjacent fingers of the plate. After the plate is formed 
and tack welded to the joint, weld all the plate edges to the 
cluster joint. [Figure 5-46]

Dents Between Clusters
A damaged tubular section can be repaired using welded 
split sleeve reinforcement. The damaged member should be 
carefully straightened and should be stop drilled at the ends 
of any cracks with a No. 40 drill bit.

Select a length of steel tube of the same material and at 
least the same wall thickness having an inside diameter 
approximately equal to the outside diameter of the 
damaged tube. 

Diagonally cut the selected piece at a 30° angle on both ends 
so the minimum distance of the sleeve from the edge of the 
crack or dent is not less than 1½ times the diameter of the 
damaged tube. Then, cut through the entire length of the 
sleeve and separate the half sections as shown in Figure 5-47.

along the length of the two sides, and weld both ends of the 
sleeve to the damaged tube. 

Tube Splicing with Inside Sleeve Reinforcement
If a partial replacement of the tube is necessary, do an 
inner sleeve splice, especially where you want a smooth  
tube surface.

Make a diagonal cut to remove the damaged section of the 
tube, and remove the burrs from the inner and outer cut edges 
with a file or similar means. Diagonally cut a replacement 
steel tube of the same material, diameter, and wall thickness 
to match the length of the removed section of the damaged 
tube. The replacement tube should allow a 1⁄8-inch gap for 
welding at each end to the stubs of the original tube. 

Select a length of steel tubing of the same material and at 
least the same wall thickness with an outside diameter equal 
to the inside diameter of the damaged tube. From this inner 
sleeve tube material, cut two sections of tubing, each of 
such a length that the ends of the inner sleeve is a minimum 
distance of 1½ times the tube diameter from the nearest end of 
the diagonal cut. Tack the outer and inner replacement tubes 
using rosette welds. Weld the inner sleeve to the tube stubs 
through the 1⁄8-inch gap forming a weld bead over the gap 
and joining with the new replacement section. [Figure 5-48]

Tube Splicing with Outer Split Sleeve 
Reinforcement
If partial replacement of a damaged tube is necessary, make 
the outer sleeve splice using a replacement tube of the same 
diameter and material. [Figures 5-49 and 5-50]

To perform the outer sleeve repair, remove the damaged 
section of the tube, utilizing a 90° cut at either end. Cut a 
replacement steel tube of the same material, diameter, and 
at least the same wall thickness to match the length of the 
removed portion of the damaged tube. The replacement 
tube must bear against the stubs of the original tube with 
a tolerance of ±1⁄64-inch. The material selected for the 
outer sleeve must be of the same material and at least the 
same wall thickness as the original tube. The clearance 
between the inside diameter of the sleeve and the outside

From this outer sleeve tube material, either cut diagonally or 
fishmouth two sections of tubing, each of such a length that 
the nearest end of the outer sleeve is a minimum distance 
of 1½ tube diameters from the end of the cut on the original 
tube. Use the fish mouth sleeve wherever possible. Remove 

all burrs from the edges of the replacement tube, sleeves, and 
the original tube stubs.

Slip the two sleeves over the replacement tube, align the 
replacement tube with the original tube stubs, and slip the 
sleeves over the center of each joint. Adjust the sleeves to 
the area to provide maximum reinforcement.

Tack weld the two sleeves to the replacement tube in 
two places before welding ends. Apply a uniform weld 
around both ends of one of the reinforcement sleeves and 
allow the weld to cool. Then, weld around both ends of 
the remaining reinforcement tube. Allow one sleeve weld 
to cool before welding the remaining tube to prevent  
undue warping. 

Landing Gear Repairs
Some components of a landing gear may be repaired 
by welding while others, when damaged, may require 
replacement. Representative types of repairable and 
nonrepairable landing gear assemblies are shown in 
Figure 5-51.

The landing gear types shown in A, B, and C of this figure 
are repairable axle assemblies. They are formed from steel 
tubing and may be repaired by any of the methods described 
in this chapter or in FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 43.13-1, 
Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and Practices—Aircraft 
Inspection and Repair. However, it must be determined if 
the assemblies were heat treated. Assemblies originally heat 
treated must be reheat treated after a welding repair.

Figure 5-51. Representative types of repairable and nonrepairable landing gear assemblies. 

The landing gear assembly type D is generally nonrepairable 
for the following reasons:

1. The lower axle stub is usually made from a highly 
heat-treated nickel alloy steel and machined to close 
tolerances. It should be replaced when damaged.

2. During manufacture, the upper oleo section of the 
assembly is heat treated and machined to close 
tolerances to assure proper functioning of the shock 
absorber. These parts would be distorted by any 
welding repair and should be replaced if damaged to 
ensure the part was airworthy.

The spring-steel leaf, shown as type E, is a component of 
a standard main landing gear on many light aircraft. The 
spring-steel part is, in general, nonrepairable, should not be 
welded on, and should be replaced when it is excessively 
sprung or otherwise damaged. 

Streamline tubing, used for some light aircraft landing gear, 
may be repaired using a round insert tube of the same material 
and having a wall thickness of one gauge thicker than the 
original streamline tube and inserting and welding as shown 
in Figure 5-52.

If all members of the mount are out of alignment, the mount 
should be replaced with one supplied by the manufacturer 
or with one built to conform to the manufacturer’s drawings 
and specifications.

Minor damage, such as a crack adjacent to an engine 
attachment lug, can be repaired by rewelding the ring and 
extending a gusset or a mounting lug past the damaged 
area. Engine mount rings that are extensively damaged must 
not be repaired unless the method of repair is specifically 
approved by FAA Engineering, a Designated Engineering 
Representative (DAR), or the repair is accomplished in 
accordance with FAA-approved instructions.

If the manufacturer stress relieved the engine mount after 
welding, the engine mount should again be stress relieved 
after weld repairs are made.
  
Rosette Welding
Rosette welds are used on many of the type repairs that were 
previously discussed. They are holes, typically one-fourth 
the diameter of the original tube, drilled in the outer splice 
and welded around the circumference for attachment to the 
inner replacement tube or original tube structure.

The streamline landing gear tube may also be repaired by 
inserting a tube of the same streamline original tubing and 
welding. This can be accomplished by cutting off the trailing 
edge of the insert and fitting it into the original tube. Once 
fitted, remove the insert, weld the trailing edge back together, 
and reinsert into the original tube. Use the figures and weld 
as indicated in Figure 5-53.

Engine Mount Repairs
All welding on an engine mount should be performed by 
an experienced welder and be of the highest quality, since 
vibration tends to accentuate any minor defect. 

The preferred method to repair an engine mount member 
is by using a larger diameter replacement tube telescoped 
over the stub of the original member using fish-mouth and 
rosette welds. 30° scarf welds are also acceptable in place 
of the fish-mouth welds.

One of the most important aspects to keep in mind when 
repairing an engine mount is that the alignment of the 
structure must be maintained. This can be accomplished by 
attaching to a fixture designed for that purpose, or bolting the 
mount to an engine and/or airframe before welding. 

All cracked welds should be ground out and only high-grade 
filler rod of the appropriate material should be used.

Aircraft Wood 
and Structural Repair
Aircraft Wood and Structural Repair
Wood was among the first materials used to construct aircraft. 
Most of the airplanes built during World War I (WWI) were 
constructed of wood frames with fabric coverings. Wood 
was the material of choice for aircraft construction into the 
1930s. Part of the reason was the slow development of strong, 
lightweight, metal aircraft structures and the lack of suitable 
corrosion-resistant materials for all-metal aircraft. 


6-2

Figure 6-1. British DeHavilland Mosquito bomber.

Figure 6-2. Hughes Flying Boat, H-4 Hercules named the Spruce 
Goose.

In the late 1930s, the British airplane company DeHavilland 
designed and developed a bomber named the Mosquito. 
Well into the late 1940s, DeHavilland produced more than 
7,700 airplanes made of spruce, birch plywood, and balsa 
wood. [Figure 6-1]

During the early part of WWII, the U.S. government put 
out a contract to build three flying boats. Hughes Aircraft 
ultimately won the contract with the mandate to use only 
materials not critical to the war, such as aluminum and steel. 
Hughes designed the aircraft to be constructed out of wood.

After many delays and loss of government funding, Howard 
Hughes continued construction, using his own money and 
completing one aircraft. On November 2, 1947, during taxi 
tests in the harbor at Long Beach, California, Hughes piloted 
the Spruce Goose for over a mile at an altitude of 70 feet, 
proving it could fly. 

This was the largest seaplane and the largest wooden aircraft 
ever constructed. Its empty weight was 300,000 pounds with 
a maximum takeoff weight of 400,000 pounds. The entire 
airframe, surface structures, and flaps were composed of 
laminated wood with fabric covered primary control surfaces. 
It was powered by eight Pratt & Whitney R-4360 radial 
engines, each producing 3,000 horsepower. [Figure 6-2]

As aircraft design and manufacturing evolved, the 
development of lightweight metals and the demand for 
increased production moved the industry away from aircraft 
constructed entirely of wood. Some general aviation aircraft 
were produced with wood spars and wings, but today only a 
limited number of wood aircraft are produced. Most of those 
are built by their owners for education or recreation and not 
for production.  

Quite a number of airplanes in which wood was used as 
the primary structural material still exist and are operating, 
including certificated aircraft that were constructed during 
the 1930s and later. With the proper maintenance and 
repair procedures, these older aircraft can be maintained 
in an airworthy condition and kept operational for many 
years.  

Wood Aircraft Construction and Repairs
The information presented in this chapter is general in 
nature and should not be regarded as a substitute for 
specific instructions contained in the aircraft manufacturer’s 
maintenance and repair manuals. Methods of construction 
vary greatly with different types of aircraft, as do the various 
repair and maintenance procedures required to keep them 
airworthy. 

When specific manufacturer’s manuals and instructions are 
not available, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
Advisory Circular (AC) 43.13-1, Acceptable Methods, 
Techniques, and Practices—Aircraft Inspection and Repair, 
can be used as reference for inspections and repairs. The AC 
details in the first paragraph, Purpose, the criteria necessary 
for its use. In part, it stipulates that the use of the AC is 
acceptable to the FAA for the inspection and minor repair 
of nonpressurized areas of civil aircraft. 

It also specifies that the repairs identified in the AC may 
also be used as a basis for FAA approval of major repairs 
when listed in block 8 of FAA Form 337, Major Repair and 
Alteration, when: 

1. The user has determined that it is appropriate to the 
product being repaired;

2.  It is directly applicable to the repair being made; and 

3.  It is not contrary to manufacturer’s data. 

Certificated mechanics that have the experience of working 
on wooden aircraft are becoming rare. Title 14 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 65 states in part that a 
certificated mechanic may not perform any work for which 
he or she is rated unless he or she has performed the work 
concerned at an earlier date. This means that if an individual 
does not have the previous aviation woodworking experience

performing the repair on an aircraft, regulation requires a 
certificated and appropriately rated mechanic or repairman 
who has had previous experience in the operation concerned 
to supervise that person. 

The ability to inspect wood structures and recognize defects 
(dry rot, compression failures, etc.) can be learned through 
experience and instruction from knowledgeable certificated 
mechanics and appropriately qualified technical instructors. 

Inspection of Wood Structures  
To properly inspect an aircraft constructed or comprised 
of wood components, the aircraft must be dry. It should be 
placed in a dry, well-ventilated hangar with all inspection 
covers, access panels, and removable fairings opened and 
removed. This allows interior sections and compartments to 
thoroughly dry. Wet, or even damp, wood causes swelling 
and makes it difficult to make a proper determination of the 
condition of the glue joints. 

If there is any doubt that the wood is dry, a moisture meter 
should be utilized to verify the percentage of moisture in 
the structure. Nondestructive meters are available that check 
moisture without making holes in the surface. The ideal range 
is 8–12 percent, with any reading over 20 percent providing 
an environment for the growth of fungus in the wood.  

External and Internal Inspection
The inspection should begin with an examination of the 
external surface of the aircraft. This provides a general 
assessment of the overall condition of the wood and structure. 
The wings, fuselage, and empennage should be inspected for 
undulation, warping, or any other disparity from the original 
shape. Where the wings, fuselage, or empennage structure 
and skins form stressed structures, no departure from the 
original contour or shape is permissible. [Figure 6-3]  
         
Where light structures using single plywood covering are 
concerned, some slight sectional undulation or bulging 
between panels may be permissible if the wood and glue 
are sound. However, where such conditions exist, a careful 
check must be made of the attachment of the plywood to its 
supporting structure. A typical example of a distorted single 
plywood structure is illustrated in Figure 6-4.

The contours and alignment of leading and trailing edges are 
of particular importance. A careful check should be made 
for any deviation from the original shape. Any distortion 
of these light plywood and spruce structures is indicative 
of deterioration, and a detailed internal inspection has to be 
made for security of these parts to the main wing structure. 
If deterioration is found in these components, the main wing 
structure may also be affected.

Quarter sawed (radial cut)

Figure 6-5. Effects of shrinkage on the various shapes during drying 
from the green condition.

Splits in the fabric covering on plywood surfaces must be 
investigated to ascertain whether the plywood skin beneath 
is serviceable. In all cases, remove the fabric and inspect the 
plywood, since it is common for a split in the plywood skin 
to initiate a similar defect in the protective fabric covering.
 
Although a preliminary inspection of the external structure 
can be useful in assessing the general condition of the aircraft, 
note that wood and glue deterioration can often take place 
inside a structure without any external indications. Where 
moisture can enter a structure, it seeks the lowest point, where 
it stagnates and promotes rapid deterioration. A musty or 
moldy odor apparent as you remove the access panels during 
the initial inspection is a good indication of moisture, fungal 
growth, and possible decay.  

Glue failure and wood deterioration are often closely 
related, and the inspection of glued joints must include an 
examination of the adjacent wood structure. NOTE: Water 
need not be present for glue deterioration to take place. 

The inspection of a complete aircraft for glue or wood 
deterioration requires scrutiny of parts of the structure 
that may be known, or suspected, trouble spots. In many 
instances, these areas are boxed in or otherwise inaccessible. 
Considerable dismantling may be required. It may be 
necessary to cut access holes in some of the structures to 
facilitate the inspection. Do such work only in accordance 
with approved drawings or instructions in the maintenance 
manual for the aircraft concerned. If drawings and manuals 
are not available, engineering review may be required before 
cutting access holes.

Glued Joint Inspection
The inspection of glued joints in wooden aircraft structures 
presents considerable difficulties. Even where access to the 
joint exists, it is still difficult to positively assess the integrity 
of the joint. Keep this in mind when inspecting any glue joint.

Some common factors in premature glue deterioration 
include: 

• Chemical reactions of the glue caused by aging or 
moisture, extreme temperatures, or a combination of 
these factors.

• Mechanical forces caused mainly by wood shrinkage.

• Development of fungal growths.

An aircraft painted in darker colors experiences higher 
skin temperatures and heat buildup within its structure. 
Perform a more detailed inspection on a wooden aircraft 
structure immediately beneath the upper surfaces for signs 
of deteriorating adhesives.

Aircraft that are exposed to large cyclic changes of 
temperature and humidity are especially prone to wood 
shrinkage that may lead to glue joint deterioration. The 
amount of movement of a wooden member due to these 
changes varies with the size of each member, the rate of 
growth of the tree from which it was cut, and the way the 
wood was converted in relation to the grain. 

This means that two major structural members joined to each 
other by glue are not likely to have identical characteristics. 
Over a period of time, differential loads are transmitted 
across the glue joint because the two members do not react 
identically. This imposes stresses in the glue joint that can 
normally be accommodated when the aircraft is new and for 
some years afterwards. However, glue tends to deteriorate 
with age, and stresses at the glued joints may cause failure of 
the joints. This is a fact even when the aircraft is maintained 
under ideal conditions.

The various cuts of lumber from a tree have tendency to 
shrink and warp in the direction(s) indicated in the yellow 
area around each cut in Figure 6-5.       
                       
When checking a glue line (the edge of the glued joint) for 
condition, all protective coatings of paint should be removed 
by careful scraping. It is important to ensure that the wood is 
not damaged during the scraping operation. Scraping should 
cease immediately when the wood is revealed in its natural 
state and the glue line is clearly discernible. At this point in 
the inspection, it is important that the surrounding wood is 
dry; otherwise, you will get a false indication of the integrity 
of the glue line due to swelling of the wood and subsequent 
closing of the joint.

Figure 6-6. Inspection points for laminated glue joints.

Inspect the glue line using a magnifying glass. Where the glue 
line tends to part, or where the presence of glue cannot be 
detected or is suspect, probe the glue line with a thin feeler 
gauge. If any penetration is observed, the joint is defective. 
The structure usually dictates the feeler gauge thickness, 
but use the thinnest feeler gauge whenever possible. The 
illustration indicates the points a feeler gauge should 
probe. [Figure 6-6]

Pressure exerted on a joint either by the surrounding structure 
or by metal attachment devices, such as bolts or screws, can 
cause a false appearance of the glue condition. The joint must 
be relieved of this pressure before the glue line inspection 
is performed.

A glued joint may fail in service as a result of an accident or 
because of excessive mechanical loads having been imposed 
upon it. Glued joints are generally designed to take shear 
loads. If a joint is expected to take tension loads, it is secured 
by a number of bolts or screws in the area of tension loading. 
In all cases of glued joint failure, whatever the direction of 
loading, there should be a fine layer of wood fibers adhering 
to the glue. The presence of fibers usually indicates that the 
joint itself is not at fault.

Examination of the glue under magnification that does not 
reveal any wood fibers, but shows an imprint of the wood 
grain, indicates that the cause of the failure was the predrying 
of the glue before applying pressure during the manufacture 
of the joint. If the glue exhibits an irregular appearance with 
star-shaped patterns, this is an indication that precuring of the 
glue occurred before pressure was applied, or that pressure
had been incorrectly applied or maintained on the joint. If 

there is no evidence of wood fiber adhesion, there may also 
be glue deterioration.   

Wood Condition 
Wood decay and dry rot are usually easy to detect. Decay 
may be evident as either a discoloration or a softening of 
the wood. Dry rot is a term loosely applied to many types 
of decay, but especially to a condition that, in an advanced 
stage, permits the wood to be crushed to a dry powder. The 
term is actually a misnomer for any decay, since all fungi 
require considerable moisture for growth.

Dark discolorations of the wood or gray stains running 
along the grain are indicative of water penetration. If such 
discoloration cannot be removed by light scraping, replace 
the part. Disregard local staining of the wood by dye from a 
synthetic adhesive hardener. 

In some instances where water penetration is suspected, a 
few screws removed from the area in question reveal, by 
their degree of corrosion, the condition of the surrounding 
joint. [Figure 6-7] 
  
Another method of detecting water penetration is to remove 
the bolts holding the fittings at spar root-end joints, aileron 
hinge brackets, etc. Corrosion on the surface of such bolts 
and wood discoloration provide a useful indication of water 
penetration.

Plain brass screws are normally used for reinforcing glued 
wooden members. For hardwoods, such as mahogany or ash, 
steel screws may be used. Unless specified by the aircraft

Inspection experience with a particular type of aircraft 
provides insight to the specific areas most prone to water 
penetration and moisture entrapment. Wooden aircraft are 
more prone to the damaging effects of water, especially 
without the protection of covered storage. Control system 
openings, fastener holes, cracks or breaks in the finish, and 
the interfaces of metal fittings and the wood structure are 
points that require additional attention during an inspection. 
Additionally, windshield and window frames, the area 
under the bottom of entrance and cargo doors, and the lower 
sections of the wing and fuselage are locations that require 
detailed inspections for water damage and corrosion on 
all aircraft. 

The condition of the fabric covering on plywood surfaces 
provides an indication of the condition of the wood 
underneath. If there is any evidence of poor adhesion, cracks 
in the fabric, or swelling of the wood, remove the fabric to 
allow further inspection. The exposed surface shows water 
penetration by the existence of dark gray streaks along the 
grain and dark discoloration at ply joints or screw holes. 

Cracks in wood spars are often hidden under metal fittings 
or metal rib flanges and leading edge skins. Any time a 
reinforcement plate exists that is not feathered out on its ends, 

a stress riser exists at the ends of the plate. A failure of the 
primary structure can be expected at this point. [Figure 6-8] 

As part of the inspection, examine the structure for other 
defects of a mechanical nature, including any location where 
bolts secure fittings that take load-carrying members, or 
where the bolts are subject to landing or shear loads. Remove 
the bolts and examine the holes for elongation or surface 
crushing of the wood fibers. It is important to ensure the bolts 
are a good fit in the holes. Check for evidence of bruises or 
crushing of the structural member, which can be caused by 
overtorquing of the bolts.

Compression failure

Figure 6-9. Pronounced compression failure in wood beam.

Check all metal fittings that are attached to a wood structure 
for looseness, corrosion, cracks, or bending. Areas of 
particular concern are strut attach fittings, spar butt fittings, 
aileron and flap hinges, jury strut fittings, compression struts, 
control cable pulley brackets, and landing gear fittings. All 
exposed end grain wood, particularly the spar butts, should 
be inspected for cracking or checking.  

Inspect structural members for compression failures, which 
is indicated by rupture across the wood fibers. This is a 
serious defect that can be difficult to detect. If a compression 
failure is suspected, a flashlight beam shown along the 
member and running parallel to the grain, will assist in 
revealing it. The surface will appear to have minute ridges 
or lines running across the grain. Particular attention is 
necessary when inspecting any wooden member that has 
been subjected to abnormal bending or compression loads 
during a hard landing. If undetected, compression failures 
of the spar may result in structural failure of the wing during 
flight. [Figure 6-9]

When a member has been subjected to an excessive bending 
load, the failure appears on the surface that has been 
compressed. The surface subject to tension normally shows 
no defects. In the case of a member taking an excessive direct 
compression load, the failure is apparent on all surfaces.

The front and rear spars should be checked for longitudinal 
cracks at the ends of the plywood reinforcement plates 
where the lift struts attach. [Figure 6-8] Check the ribs on 
either side of the strut attach points for cracks where the cap 
strips pass over and under the spars, and for missing or loose 
rib-to-spar attach nails. All spars, those in the wing(s) and 
empennage, should be inspected on the face and top surface 
for compression cracks. A borescope can be utilized by 
accessing existing inspection holes.   

Various mechanical methods can be employed to enhance 
the visual inspection of wood structures. Tapping the subject 

area with a light plastic hammer or screwdriver handle should 
produce a sharp solid sound. If the suspected area sounds 
hollow and dull, further inspection is warranted. Use a sharp 
metal awl or thin-bladed screwdriver  to probe the area. The 
wood structure should be solid and firm. If the area is soft 
and mushy, the wood is rotted and disassembly and repair 
of the structure is necessary.

Repair of Wood Aircraft Structures
The standard for any repair is that it should return the aircraft 
or component to its original condition in strength, function, 
and aerodynamic shape. It should also be accomplished in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications and/or 
instructions, or other approved data.

The purpose of repairing all wood structural components 
is to obtain a structure as strong as the original. Major 
damage probably requires replacement of the entire damaged 
assembly, but minor damage can be repaired by removing 
or cutting away the damaged members and replacing them 
with new sections. This replacement may be accomplished by 
gluing, glue and nails, or glue and screw-reinforced splicing.

Materials
Several forms of wood are commonly used in aircraft. 

• Solid wood or the adjective “solid” used with such 
nouns as “beam” or “spar” refers to a member 
consisting of one piece of wood. 

• Laminated wood is an assembly of two or more layers 
of wood that have been glued together with the grain 
of all layers or laminations approximately parallel.

• Plywood is an assembled product of wood and glue 
that is usually made of an odd number of thin plies, or 
veneers, with the grain of each layer placed 90° with 
the adjacent ply or plies.

• High-density material includes compreg, impreg, or 
similar commercially made products, heat-stabilized 
wood, or any of the hardwood plywoods commonly 
used as bearing or reinforcement plates.

 
Suitable Wood 
The various species of wood listed in Figure 6-10 are 
acceptable for structural purposes when used for the repair 
of aircraft. Spruce is the preferred choice and the standard 
by which the other wood is measured. Figure 6-10 provides 
a comparison of other wood that may be suitable for aircraft 
repair. It lists the strength and characteristics of the wood 
in comparison to spruce. The one item common to all the 
species is that the slope of the grain cannot be steeper  
than 1:15.

Figure 6-10. Selection and properties of wood for aircraft repairs.

All solid wood and plywood used for the construction and 
repair of aircraft should be of the highest quality and grade. 
For certificated aircraft, the wood should have traceability to a 
source that can provide certification to a military specification 
(MIL-SPEC). The term “aircraft quality” or “aircraft grade” 
is referred to and specified in some repair documents, but 
that grade wood cannot be purchased from a local lumber 
company. To purchase the material, contact one of the 
specialty aircraft supply companies and request a certification 
document with the order. The MIL-SPEC for solid spruce is 
MIL-S-6073 and for plywood it is MIL-P-6070B.  

When possible, fabricated wood components should be 
purchased from the aircraft manufacturer, or someone 
who may have a Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) to 

produce replacement parts for the aircraft. With either of 
these sources supplying the wood components, the mechanic 
can be assured of installing approved material. At the 
completion of the repair, as always, it is the responsibility of 
the person returning the aircraft to service to determine the 
quality of the replacement wood and the airworthiness of the  
subsequent repair. 

To help determine the suitability of the wood, inspect it 
for defects that would make it unsuitable material to repair 
or construct an aircraft. The type, location, and amount 
or size of the defects grade the wood for possible use. All 
woods used for structural repair of aircraft are classified as 
softwood. Softwood is typically used for construction and is 
graded based on strength, load carrying ability, and safety. 


6-9

Hardwoods, on the other hand, are typically appearance 
woods and are graded based on the number and size of clear 
cuttings from the tree.

Defects Permitted        
The following defects are permitted in the wood species used 
for aircraft repair that are identified in Figure 6-10: 

1.  Cross grain—Spiral grain, diagonal grain, or a 
combination of the two is acceptable if the grain 
does not diverge from the longitudinal axis of the 
material more than specified in Figure 6-10 column 
3. A check of all four faces of the board is necessary 
to determine the amount of divergence. The direction 
of free-flowing ink frequently assists in determining 
grain direction.

2.  Wavy, curly, and interlocked grain—Acceptable, if 
local irregularities do not exceed limitations specified 
for spiral and diagonal grain.

3.  Hard knots—Sound, hard knots up to 3⁄8-inch in 
diameter are acceptable if: (1) they are not projecting 
portions of I-beams, along the edges of rectangular or 
beveled unrouted beams, or along the edges of flanges 
of box beams (except in portions of low stress); (2) 
they do not cause grain divergence at the edges of the 
board or in the flanges of a beam more than specified 
in Figure 6-10 column 3; and (3) they are in the center 
third of the beam and not closer than 20-inches to 
another knot or other defect (pertains to 3⁄8-inch knots; 
smaller knots may be proportionately closer). Knots 
greater than ¼-inch must be used with caution.

4.  Pin knot clusters—Small clusters are acceptable if 
they produce only a small effect on grain direction.

5.  Pitch pockets—Acceptable in center portion of a beam 
if they are at least 14-inches apart when they lie in 
the same growth ring and do not exceed 1½-inches in 
length by 1⁄8-inch width by 1⁄8-inch depth, and if they 
are not along the projecting portions of I-beams, along 
the edges of rectangular or beveled unrouted beams, 
or along the edges of the flanges of box beams.

6.  Mineral streaks—Acceptable if careful inspection fails 
to reveal any decay.

Defects Not Permitted           
The following defects are not permitted in wood used for 
aircraft repair. If a defect is listed as unacceptable, please refer 
to the previous section, Defects Permitted, for acceptable 
conditions.

1.  Cross grain—unacceptable.

2.  Wavy, curly, and interlocked grain – unacceptable.

3.  Hard knots—unacceptable.

4.  Pin knot clusters—unacceptable, if they produce large 
effect on grain direction.

5.  Spike knots—knots running completely through the 
depth of a beam perpendicular to the annual rings 
and appear most frequently in quarter-sawed lumber. 
Reject wood containing this defect.

6.  Pitch pockets—unacceptable.

7.  Mineral streaks—unacceptable, if accompanied by 
decay.

8.  Checks, shakes, and splits—checks are longitudinal 
cracks extending, in general, across the annual rings. 
Shakes are longitudinal cracks usually between two 
annual rings. Splits are longitudinal cracks caused by 
artificially induced stress. Reject wood containing 
these defects.

9.  Compression—very detrimental to strength and is 
difficult to recognize readily, compression wood  
is characterized by high specific gravity, has the 
appearance of an excessive growth of summer wood, 
and in most species shows little contrast in color 
between spring wood and summer wood. If in doubt, 
reject the material or subject samples to toughness 
machine test to establish the quality of the wood. 
Reject all material containing compression wood.

10.  Compression failures—caused from overstress in 
compression due to natural forces during the growth 
of the tree, felling trees on rough or irregular ground, 
or rough handling of logs or lumber. Compression 
failures are characterized by a buckling of the fibers 
that appears as streaks substantially at right angles to 
the grain on the surface of the piece, and vary from 
pronounced failures to very fine hairlines that require 
close inspection to detect. Reject wood containing 
obvious failures. If in doubt, reject the wood or 
make a further inspection in the form of microscopic 
examination or toughness test, the latter being  
more reliable.

11.  Tension—forming on the upper side of branches and 
leaning trunks of softwood trees, tension wood is 
caused by the natural overstressing of trying to pull 
the branches and leaning trunk upright. It is typically 
harder, denser, and may be darker in color than normal 
wood, and is a serious defect, having higher than usual 
longitudinal shrinkage that may break down due to 
uneven shrinkage. When in doubt, reject the wood.  

12.  Decay—rot, dote, red heart, purple heart, etc., must 
not appear on any piece. Examine all stains and 
discoloration carefully to determine whether or not 
they are harmless or in a stage of preliminary or 
advanced decay.

Glues (Adhesives)
Because adhesives play a critical role in the bonding of 
aircraft structure, the mechanic must employ only those types 
of adhesives that meet all of the performance requirements 
necessary for use in certificated aircraft. The product must 
be used strictly in accordance with the aircraft and adhesive 
manufacturer’s instructions. All instructions must be 
followed exactly, including the mixing ratios, the ambient and 
surface temperatures, the open and closed assembly times, 
the gap-filling ability, or glue line thickness, the spread of 
the adhesive, whether one or two surfaces, and the amount 
of clamping pressure and time required for full cure of  
the adhesive.

AC 43.13-1 provides information on the criteria for 
identifying adhesives that are acceptable to the FAA. It 
stipulates the following:

1. Refer to the aircraft maintenance or repair manual for 
specific instructions on acceptable adhesive selection 
for use on that type aircraft.

2. Adhesives meeting the requirements of a MIL-
SPEC, Aerospace Material Specification (AMS), or 
Technical Standard Order (TSO) for wooden aircraft 
structures are satisfactory, provided they are found 
to be compatible with existing structural materials 
in the aircraft and fabrication methods to be used in  
the repair.

New adhesives have been developed in recent years, and some 
of the older ones are still in use. Some of the more common 
adhesives that have been used in aircraft construction and 
repair include casein glue, plastic resin glue, resorcinol glue, 
and epoxy adhesives. 

Casein glue should be considered obsolete for all aircraft 
repairs. The adhesive deteriorates when exposed to moisture 
and temperature variations that are part of the normal 
operating environment of any aircraft. 

NOTE: Some modern adhesives are incompatible with casein 
adhesive. If a joint that has previously been bonded with 
casein is to be reglued using another type adhesive, all traces 
of the casein must be scraped off before a new adhesive is 
applied. If any casein adhesive is left, residual alkalinity may 
cause the new adhesive to fail to cure properly. 

Plastic resin glue, also known as a urea-formaldehyde 
adhesive, came on the market in the middle to late 1930s. 
Tests and practical applications have shown that exposure 
to moist conditions, and particularly to a warm humid 
environment, under swell-shrink stress, leads to deterioration 
and eventual failure of the bond. For these reasons, plastic 
resin glue should be considered obsolete for all aircraft 

repairs. Discuss any proposed use of this type adhesive on 
aircraft with FAA engineering prior to use.     

Resorcinol glue, or resorcinol-formaldehyde glue, is a 
two-component synthetic adhesive consisting of resin 
and a catalyst. It was first introduced in 1943 and almost 
immediately found wide application in the wood boat-building 
and wood aircraft industry in which the combination of high 
durability and moderate-temperature curing was extremely 
important. It has better wet-weather and ultraviolet (UV) 
resistance than other adhesives. This glue meets all strength 
and durability requirements if the fit of the joint and proper 
clamping pressure results in a very thin and uniform bond line. 

The manufacturer’s product data sheets must be followed 
regarding mixing, usable temperature range, and the open 
and close assembly times. It is very important that this type 
of glue is used at the recommended temperatures because 
the full strength of the joint cannot be relied on if assembly 
and curing temperatures are below 70 °F. With that in mind, 
higher temperatures shorten the working life because of a 
faster cure rate, and open and closed assembly times must 
be shortened.  

Epoxy adhesive is a two-part synthetic resin product 
that depends less on joint quality and clamping pressure. 
However, many epoxies have not exhibited joint durability 
in the presence of moisture and elevated temperatures and 
are not recommended for structural aircraft bonding unless 
they meet the acceptable standards set forth by the FAA in 
AC 43.13-1, as referenced earlier in this chapter. 

Definition of Terms Used in the Glue Process  

• Close contact adhesive—a non-gap-filling adhesive 
(e.g., resorcinol-formaldehyde glue) suitable for use 
only in those joints where the surfaces to be joined can 
be brought into close contact by means of adequate 
pressure, to allow a glue line of no more than 0.005-
inch gap.

• Gap-filling adhesive—an adhesive suitable for use 
in those joints in which the surfaces to be joined 
may not be close or in continuous contact (e.g., 
epoxy adhesives) due either to the impracticability 
of applying adequate pressure or to the slight 
inaccuracies of fabricating the joint.

• Glue line—resultant layer of adhesive joining any two 
adjacent wood layers in the assembly.

• Single spread—spread of adhesive to one surface only.

• Double spread—spread of adhesive to both surfaces 
and equally divided between the two surfaces to  
be joined.


6-11

• Open assembly time—period of time between the 
application of the adhesive and the assembly of the 
joint components.

• Closed assembly time—time elapsing between the 
assembly of the joints and the application of pressure.

• Pressing or clamping time—time during which 
the components are pressed tightly together under 
recommended pressure until the adhesive cures (may 
vary from 10 to 150 pounds per square inch (psi) for 
softwoods, depending on the viscosity of the glue).

• Caul—a clamping device, usually two rigid wooden 
bars, to keep an assembly of flat panel boards aligned 
during glue-up. It is assembled with long bolts and 
placed on either side of the boards, one on top and 
another below, and parallel with the pipe/bar clamps. 
A caul is usually finished and waxed before each use 
to keep glue from adhering to it. 

• Adhesive pot life—time elapsed from the mixing 
of the adhesive components until the mixture must 
be discarded, because it no longer performs to its 
specifications. The manufacturer’s product data sheet 
may define this as working time or useful life; once 
expired, the adhesive must not be used. It lists the 
specific temperature and quantity at which the sample 
amount can be worked. Pot life is a product of time 
and temperature. The cooler the mix is kept, within 
the recommended temperature range, the longer it  
is usable. 

Preparation of Wood for Gluing
Satisfactory glue joints in aircraft should develop the 
full strength of the wood under all conditions of stress. 
To produce this result, the conditions involved in the 
gluing operation must be carefully controlled to obtain a 
continuous, thin, uniform film of solid glue in the joint 
with adequate adhesion to both surfaces of the wood. These  
conditions required:

1. Proper and equal moisture content of wood to be joined 
(8 to 12 percent).

2. Properly prepared wood surfaces that are machined 
or planed, and not sanded or sawed.

3. Selection of the proper adhesive for the intended task, 
which is properly prepared and of good quality. 

4. The application of good gluing techniques, including 
fitment, recommended assembly times, and adequate 
equal pressure applied to the joint.

5. Performing the gluing operation under the 
recommended temperature conditions.  



The surfaces to be joined must be clean, dry, and free from 
grease, oil, wax, paint, etc. Keep large prepared surfaces 
covered with a plastic sheet or masking paper prior to the 
bonding operation. It is advisable to clean all surfaces with 
a vacuum cleaner just prior to adhesive application.  

Smooth even surfaces produced on planers and joiners 
with sharp knives and correct feed adjustments are the best 
surfaces for gluing solid wood. The use of sawn surfaces 
for gluing has been discouraged for aircraft component 
assembly because of the difficulty in producing a surface 
free of crushed fibers. Glue joints made on surfaces that are 
covered with crushed fibers do not develop the normal full 
strength of the wood. 

Some of the surface changes in plywood, such as glazing 
and bleed-through, that occur in manufacture and may 
interfere with the adhesion of glue in secondary gluing 
are easily recognized. A light sanding of the surface with 
220-grit sandpaper in the direction of the grain restores the 
surface fibers to their original condition, removes the gloss, 
and improves the adhesion of the glue. In contrast to these 
recognized surface conditions, wax deposits from cauls used 
during hot pressing produce unfavorable gluing surfaces that 
are not easily detected.
   
Wetting tests are a useful means of detecting the presence of 
wax. A finely sprayed mist or drops of water on the surface of 
wax-coated plywood bead and do not wet the wood. This test 
may also give an indication of the presence of other materials 
or conditions that would degrade a glue joint. Only a proper 
evaluation of the adhesion properties, using gluing tests, 
determines the gluing characteristics of the plywood surfaces.

Preparing Glues for Use
The manufacturer’s directions should be followed for the 
preparation of any glue or adhesive. Unless otherwise specified 
by the glue manufacturer, clear, cool water should be used 
with glues that require mixing with water. The recommended 
proportions of glue, catalyst, and water or other solvent should 
be determined by the weight of each component. Mixing can 
be either by hand or machine. Whatever method is used, the 
glue should be thoroughly mixed and free of air bubbles, 
foam, and lumps of insoluble material.     
 
Applying the Glue/Adhesive 
To make a satisfactorily bonded joint, it is generally desirable 
to apply adhesive to both surfaces and join in a thin even layer. 
The adhesive can be applied with a brush, glue spreader, or 
a grooved rubber roller. Follow the adhesive manufacturer’s 
application instructions for satisfactory results.

Figure 6-12. Examples of differences for open and closed assembly times.

Be careful to ensure the surfaces make good contact and the 
joint is positioned correctly before applying the adhesive. 
Keep the open assembly time as short as possible and do 
not exceed the recommended times indicated in the product 
data sheet. 

Pressure on the Joint
To ensure the maximum strength of the bonded surfaces, 
apply even force to the joint. Non-uniform gluing pressure 
commonly results in weak areas and strong areas in the 
same joint. The results of applied pressure are illustrated in 
Figure 6-11.  

Use pressure to squeeze the glue out into a thin continuous 
film between the wood layers, to force air from the joint, to 
bring the wood surfaces into intimate contact with the glue, 
and to hold them in this position during the setting of the glue. 
Pressure may be applied by means of clamps, elastic straps, 
weight, vacuum bags, or other mechanical devices. Other 
methods used to apply pressure to joints in aircraft gluing 
operations range from the use of brads, nails, and screws to 
the use of electric and hydraulic power presses. 

The amount of pressure required to produce strong joints in 
aircraft assembly operations may vary from 10 to 150 psi for 
softwoods and as high as 200 psi for hardwoods. Insufficient 

pressure to poorly machined or fitted wood joints usually 
results in a thick glue line, indicating a weak joint, and should 
be carefully avoided. 

High clamping pressure is neither essential nor desirable, 
provided good contact between the surfaces being joined is 
obtained. When pressure is applied, a small quantity of glue 
should be squeezed from the joint. This excess should be 
removed before it sets. It is important that full pressure be  
maintained on the joint for the entire cure time of the adhesive 
because the adhesive does not chemically relink and bond if 
it is disturbed before it is fully cured.

The full curing time of the adhesive is dependent on the 
ambient temperature; therefore, it is very important to 
follow the manufacturer’s product data sheets for all phases 
of the gluing operation from the shelf life to the moisture 
content of the wood to the proper mixing of the adhesive 
to the application, and especially to the temperature. 
The successful assembly and fabrication depends on the 
workmanship and quality of the joints and following the glue  
manufacturer’s instructions.

All gluing operations should be performed above 70 °F for 
proper performance of the adhesive. Higher temperatures 
shorten the assembly times, as does coating the pieces of 
wood with glue and exposing openly to the air. This open 
assembly promotes a more rapid thickening of the glue than 
pieces being mated together as soon as the spreading of the 
glue is completed. 

Figure 6-12 provides an example of resorcinol resin glue and 
the allowable assembly times and gluing pressure when in 
the open and closed assembly condition. All examples are 
for an ambient temperature of 75 °F.

Figure 6-13 provides examples of strong and weak glue joints 
resulting from different gluing conditions. A is a well-glued 
joint with a high percentage of wood failure made under 
proper conditions; B is a glue-starved joint resulting from 
the application of excessive pressure with thin glues; C is a 
dried glue joint resulting from an excessively long assembly 
time and/or insufficient pressure.

Testing Glued Joints 
Satisfactory glue joints in aircraft should develop the full 
strength of the wood under all conditions of stress. Tests 
should be made by the mechanic prior to gluing a joint of 
a major repair, such as a wing spar. Whenever possible, 
perform tests using pieces cut from the actual wood used 
for the repair under the same mechanical and environmental 
conditions that the repair will undergo.

Perform a sample test using two pieces of scrap wood from 
the intended repair, each cut approximately 1"" × 2"" × 4"". The 
pieces should be joined by overlapping each approximately 2 
inches. The type of glue, pressure, and curing time should be 
the same as used for the actual repair. After full cure, place 
the test sample in a bench vise and break the joint by exerting 
pressure on the overlapping member. The fractured glue 
faces should show a high percentage of at least 75 percent 
of the wood fibers evenly distributed over the fractured glue 
surface. [Figure 6-14]       
       

Repair of Wood Aircraft Components
Wing Rib Repairs 
Ribs that have sustained damage may be repaired or 
replaced, depending upon the type of damage and location 
in the aircraft. If new parts are available from the aircraft 
manufacturer or the holder of a PMA for the part, it is 
advisable to replace the part rather than to repair it. 

If you make a repair to a rib, do the work in such a manner 
and using materials of such quality that the completed repair 
is at least equal to the original part in aerodynamic function, 
structural strength, deterioration, and other qualities affecting 
airworthiness, such as fit and finish. When manufacturer’s 
repair manuals or instructions are not available, acceptable 
methods of repairing damaged ribs are described in AC 
43.13-1 under Wood Structure Repairs. 

When necessary, a rib can be fabricated and installed using 
the same materials and dimensions from a manufacturer-
approved drawing or by reference to an original rib. However, 
if you fabricated it from an existing rib, you must provide 
evidence to verify that the dimensions are accurate and the 
materials are correct for the replacement part.  
 
You can repair a cap strip of a wood rib using a scarf splice. 
The repair is reinforced on the side opposite the wing 
covering by a spruce block that extends beyond the scarf 
joint not less than three times the thickness of the strips being 
repaired. Reinforce the entire splice, including the spruce 
reinforcing block, on each side with a plywood side plate.

Figure 6-17. Cap strip repair at a spar.

The scarf length bevel is 10 times dimension A (thickness of 
the rib cap strip) with the spruce reinforcement block being 
16 times dimension A (the scarf length plus extension on 
either end of the scarf). The plywood splice plates should 
be of the same material and thickness as the original plates 
used to fabricate the rib. The spruce block should have a 5:1 
bevel on each end. [Figure 6-15]

These specific rib repairs describing the use of one scarf 
splice implies that either the entire forward or aft portion of 
the cap strip beyond the damage can be replaced to complete 
the repair and replace the damaged section. Otherwise, 
replacement of the damaged section may require a splice 
repair at both ends of the replaced section of the cap strip 
using the indicated dimensions for cutting and reinforcing 
of each splice.

When a cap strip is to be repaired at a point where there is 
a joint between it and cross members of the rib, make the 
repair by reinforcing the scarf joint with plywood gussets, 
as shown in Figure 6-16.

If a cap strip must be repaired where it crosses a spar, 
reinforce the joint with a continuous gusset extending over 
the spar, as shown in Figure 6-17.

The scarf joints referred to in the rib repairs are the most 
satisfactory method of fabricating an end joint between two 
solid wood members.  When the scarf splice is used to repair 
a solid wood component, the mechanic must be aware of the 
direction and slope of the grain.  To ensure the full strength 
of the joint, the scarf cut is made in the general direction 
of the grain on both connecting ends of the wood and then 
correctly oriented to each other when glued. [Figure 6-18]  

The trailing edge of a rib can be replaced and repaired by 
removing the damaged portion of the cap strip and inserting 

a softwood block of white pine, spruce, or basswood. The 
entire repair is then reinforced with plywood gussets and 
nailed and glued, as shown in Figure 6-19.

Compression ribs are of many different designs, and the 
proper method of repairing any part of this type of rib 
is specified by the manufacturer. All repairs should be 
performed using recommended or approved practices, 
materials and adhesives. 

Figure 6-20A illustrates the repair of a compression rib of 
the I section type (i.e., wide, shallow cap strips, and a center 
plywood web with a rectangular compression member on 
each side of the web). The rib damage suggests that the upper 
and lower cap strips, the web member, and the compression 
members are cracked completely through. To facilitate 
this repair, cut the compression members as shown in 
Figure 6-20D and repair as recommended using replacement 
sections to the rear spar. Cut the damaged cap strips and 
repair as shown in Figure 6-20, replacing the aft section of 
the cap strips. Plywood side plates are then bonded on each 
side diagonally to reinforce the damaged web as shown in 
Figure 6-20, A-A.
 

Figure 6-20B illustrates a compression rib of the type that is 
a standard rib with rectangle compression members added to 
one side and a plywood web to the other side. The method 
used in this repair is essentially the same as in Figure 6-20A, 
except that the plywood reinforcement plate, shown in 
Figure 6-20B-B, is continued the full distance between the 
spars.

Figure 6-20C illustrates a compression rib of the I type with 
a rectangular vertical member on each side of the web. The 
method of repair is essentially the same as in Figure 6-20A, 
except the plywood reinforcement plates on each side, shown 
in Figure 6-20C-C, are continued the full distance between 
the spars.

Wing Spar Repairs 
Wood wing spars are fabricated in various designs using solid 
wood, plywood, or a combination of the two. [Figure 6-21]

When a spar is damaged, the method of repair must conform 
to the manufacturer’s instructions and recommendations. In 
the absence of manufacturer’s instructions, contact the FAA 
for advice and approval before making repairs to the spar and 
following recommendations in AC 43.13-1. If instructions 
are not available for a specific type of repair, it is highly 
recommended that you request appropriate engineering  
assistance to evaluate and provide guidance for the  
intended repair. 

Shown in Figure 6-22 is a recommended method to repair 
either a solid or laminated rectangle spar. The slope of the 
scarf in any stressed part, such as a spar, should not be steeper 
than 15 to 1.

Unless otherwise specified by the aircraft manufacturer, a 
damaged spar may be spliced at almost any point except at 
wing attachment fittings, landing gear fittings, engine mount 
fittings, or lift-and-interplane strut fittings. These fittings may 
not overlap any part of the splice. The reinforcement plates 
of the splice should not interfere with the proper attachment 
or alignment of the fittings. Taper reinforcement plates on 
the ends at a 5:1 slope [Figure 6-23].

The use of a scarf joint to repair a spar or any other component 
of an aircraft is dependent on the accessibility to the damaged 
section. It may not be possible to utilize a scarf repair where 
recommended, so the component may have to be replaced. 
A scarf must be precisely cut on both adjoining pieces to 
ensure an even thin glue line; otherwise, the joint may not 
achieve full strength. The primary difficulty encountered in 
making this type of joint is obtaining the same bevel on each 
piece. [Figure 6-24]

The mating surfaces of the scarf must be smooth. You can 
machine smooth a saw cut using any of a variety of tools, 
such as a plane, a joiner, or a router. For most joints, you 
need a beveled fixture set at the correct slope to complete 
the cut. Figure 6-25 illustrates one method of producing an 
accurate scarf joint.

Once the two bevels are cut for the intended splice, clamp the 
pieces to a flat guide board of similar material. Then, work a 
sharp, fine-tooth saw all the way through the joint. Remove 

the saw, decrease pressure, and tap one of the pieces on the 
end to close the gap. Work the saw again through the joint. 
Continue this procedure until the joint is perfectly parallel 
with matching surfaces. Then, make a light cut with the grain, 
using a sharp plane, to smooth both mating surfaces. 

Another method of cutting a scarf uses a simple scarf-cutting 
fixture that you can also fabricate for use with a router. Extend 
the work piece beyond the edge so the finished cut results in 
a feathered edge across the end of the scarf. [Figure 6-26]

There are numerous tools made by individuals, and there are 
commercial plans for sale with instructions for building scarf- 
cutting tools. Most of them work, but some are better than 
others. The most important requirement for the tool is that it 
produces a smooth, repeatable cut at the appropriate angle.  

Local damage to the top or bottom edge of a solid spar may 
be repaired by removing the damaged portion and fabricating 
a replacement filler block of the same material as the spar.

should not be used in spar repairs. A longitudinal crack in 
a solid spar may be repaired using doublers made from the 
proper thickness plywood. Care must be taken to ensure the 
doublers extend the minimum distance beyond the crack. 
[Figure 6-27] 

A typical repair to a built-up I spar is illustrated using 
plywood reinforcement plates with solid wood filler blocks. 
As with all repairs, the reinforcement plate ends should be 
feathered out to a 5:1 slope. [Figure 6-28]  

Repair methods for the other types of spar illustrated at the 
start of this section all follow the basic steps of repair. The 
wood used should be of the same type and size as the original 
spar. Always splice and reinforce plywood webs with the 
same type of plywood as the original. Do not use solid wood 
to replace plywood webs because plywood is stronger in shear 
than solid wood of the same thickness. The splices and scarf 
cuts must be of the correct slope for the repair with the face 
grain running in the same direction as the original member. 
Not more than two splices should be made in any one spar. 

When a satisfactory repair to a spar cannot be accomplished, 
the spar should be replaced. New spars may be obtained from 
the manufacturer or the holder of a PMA for that part. An 
owner-produced spar may be installed provided it is made 
from a manufacturer-approved drawing. Care should be taken 
to ensure that any replacement spars accurately match the 
manufacturer’s original design.

Bolt and Bushing Holes
All bolts and bushings used in aircraft structures must fit 
snugly into the holes. If the bolt or bushing is loose, movement 
of the structure allows it to enlarge the hole. In the case of 
elongated bolt holes in a spar or cracks in close proximity 
to the bolt holes, the repair may require a new section to be 
spliced in the spar, or replacement of the entire spar. 

All holes drilled in a wood structure to receive bolts or 
bushings should be of such size that inserting the bolt or 
bushing requires a light tapping with a wood or rawhide 
mallet. If the hole is so tight that heavy blows are necessary, 

deformation of the wood may cause splitting or unequal load 
distribution.

For boring accurate smooth holes, it is recommended that 
a drill press be utilized where possible. Holes should be 
drilled with sharp bits using slow steady pressure. Standard 
twist drills can be used in wood when sharpened to a 60° 
angle. However, a better designed drill was developed for 
wood boring called a lip and spur or brad point. The center 
of the drill has a spur with a sharp point and four sharp 
corners to center and cut rather than walk as a conventional 
drill sometimes does. It has the outside corner of the cutting 


6-20

edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole first 
and maximizes the chance that the wood fibers cut cleanly, 
leaving a smooth bore.

Forstner bits bore precise, flat bottomed holes in wood, in 
any orientation with respect to the wood grain. They must be 
used in a drill press because more force is needed for their 
cutting action. Also, they are not designed to clear chips 
from the hole and must be pulled out periodically to do this. 
A straight, accurate bore-through hole can be completed by 
drilling through the work piece and into a piece of wood 
backing the work piece.

All holes bored for bolts that are to hold fittings in place 
should match the hole diameter in the fitting. Bushings 
made of steel, aluminum, or plastic are sometimes used to 
prevent crushing the wood when bolts are tightened. Holes 
drilled in the wood structure should be sealed after being 
drilled. This can be accomplished by application of varnish 
or other acceptable sealer into the open hole. The sealer 
must be allowed to dry or cure thoroughly prior to the bolts 
or bushings being installed.  

Plywood Skin Repairs
Plywood skin can be repaired using a number of different 
methods depending on the size of the hole and its location 
on the aircraft. Manufacturer’s instructions, when available, 
should be the first source of a repair scheme. AC 43.13-1 
provides other acceptable methods of repair. Some of those 
are featured in the following section. 

Fabric Patch  
A fabric patch is the simplest method to repair a small hole in 
plywood. This repair is used on holes not exceeding 1-inch in 
diameter after being trimmed to a smooth outline. The edges 
of the trimmed hole should first be sealed, preferably with 
a two-part epoxy varnish. This varnish requires a long cure 
time, but it provides the best seal on bare wood.

The fabric used for the patch should be of an approved 
material using the cement recommended by the manufacturer 
of the fabric system. The fabric patch should be cut with 
pinking shears and overlap the plywood skin by at least 
1-inch. A fabric patch should not be used to repair holes in 
the leading edge of a wing, in the frontal area of the fuselage, 
or nearer than 1-inch to any frame member. 
   
Splayed Patch
A splayed patch is a flush patch. The term splayed denotes 
that the edges of the patch are tapered, with the slope cut at 
a 5:1 ratio to the thickness of the skin. This may be used for 
small holes where the largest dimension of the hole to be 
repaired is not more than 15 times the skin thickness and the 

skin is not more than 1⁄10-inch thick. This calculates to nothing 
larger than a 1½-inch trimmed hole in very thin plywood.

Using the sample 1⁄10-inch thick plywood and a maximum 
trimmed hole size of 1½-inches, and cutting a 5:1 scarf, 
results in a 2½-inches round section to be patched. The patch 
should be fabricated with a 5:1 scarf, from the same type and 
thickness plywood as the surface being repaired.     

Glue is applied to the beveled edges and the patch is set with 
the grain parallel to the surface being repaired. A pressure 
plate of thicker plywood cut to the exact size of the patch is 
centered over the patch covered with waxed paper. A suitable 
weight is used for pressure until the glue has set. The repair 
is then sanded and finished to match the original surface. 
[Figure 6-29] 

Surface Patch
Plywood skins not over 1⁄8-inch thick that are damaged 
between or along framing members may be repaired with a 
surface or overlay patch. Surface patches located aft of the 
10 percent chord line, or which wrap around the leading edge 
and terminate aft of the 10 percent chord line, are permissible. 
You can use surface patches to patch trimmed holes up to 
a 50-inch perimeter, and may cover an area as large as one 
frame or rib space. 

Trim the damaged area to a rectangle or triangular shape with 
rounded corners. The radius of the corners must be at least 5 
times the skin thickness. Doublers made of plywood at least 
¼-inch thick are reinforcements placed under the edge of 
the hole inside the skin. Nail and glue the doublers in place. 
Extend the doublers from one framing member to another 
and strengthen at the ends by saddle gussets attached to the 
framing members. [Figure 6-30]

The surface patch is sized to extend beyond the cutout as 
indicated. All edges of the patch are beveled, but the leading 
edge of the patch should be beveled at an angle at least 4:1 of 
the skin thickness. The face-grain direction of the patch must 
be in the same direction of the original skin. Where possible, 
weights are used to apply pressure to a surface patch until 
the glue has dried. If the location of the patch precludes the 
use of weight, small round head wood screws can be used 
to apply glue pressure to secure the patch. After a surface 
patch has dried, the screws can be removed and the holes 
filled. The patch should be covered with fabric that overlaps 
the original surface by at least 2-inches. The fabric should 
be from one of the approved fabric covering systems using 
the procedures recommended by the manufacturer to cement 
and finish the fabric.

Plug Patch
Two types of plug patch, oval and round, may be used on 
plywood skins. Because the plug patch is only a skin repair, 
use it only for damage that does not involve the supporting 
structure under the skin.

Cut the edges of a plug patch at right angles to the surface 
of the skin. Cut the skin also to a clean round or oval hole 
with edges at right angles to the surface. Cut the patch to the 
exact size of the hole; when installed, the edge of the patch 
forms a butt joint with the edge of the hole.

You can use a round plug patch where the cutout repair is no 
larger than 6-inches in diameter. Sample dimensions for holes 
of 4-inches and 6-inches in diameter appear in Figure 6-31.

The following steps provide a method for making a round 
plug patch:

1. Cut a round patch large enough to cover the
intended repair. If applicable for size, use the sample
dimensions in Figure 6-31. The patch must be of the
same material and thickness as the original skin.

2. Place the patch over the damaged spot and mark a
circle of the same size as the patch.

3. Cut the skin inside the marked circle so that the
plug patch fits snugly into the hole around the entire
perimeter.

4. Cut a doubler of soft quarter-inch plywood, such as
poplar. A small patch is cut so that its outside radius
is 5⁄8-inch greater than the hole to be patched and
the inside radius is 5⁄8-inch less. For a large patch
the dimensions would be increased to 7⁄8-inch each.
If the curvature of the skin surface is greater than a
rise of 1⁄8-inch in 6-inches, the doubler should be
preformed to the curvature using hot water or steam.
As an alternative, the doubler may be laminated from
two pieces of 1⁄8-inch plywood.

5. Cut the doubler through one side so that it can be
inserted through the hole to the back of the skin.
Place the patch plug centered on the doubler and mark 
around its perimeter. Apply a coat of glue outside the
line to the outer half of the doubler surface that will
bear against the inner surface of the skin.

6. Install the doubler by slipping it through the cutout
hole and place it so that the mark is concentric with the 
hole. Nail it in place with nailing strips, while holding 
a bucking bar or similar object under the doubler for
backup. Place waxed paper between the nailing strips 
and the skin. Cloth webbing under the nailing strips
facilitates removal of the strips and nails after the
glue dries.

7. After the glue has set for the installed doubler, and
you have removed the nail strips, apply glue to the
inner half of the doubler and to the patch plug. Drill

screws. No other pressure is necessary.

9. After the glue has set, remove the screws and fill the

The steps for making an oval plug patch are identical to those 
for making the round patch. The maximum dimensions for 
large oval patches are 7-inches long and 5-inches wide. Oval 
patches must be cut, so when installed, the face grain matches 
the direction of the original surface. [Figure 6-32] 
 
Scarf Patch
A properly prepared and installed scarf patch is the best repair 
for damaged plywood and is preferred for most skin repairs. 
The scarf patch has edges beveled at a 12:1 slope; the splayed 
patch is beveled at a 5:1 slope. The scarf patch also uses 
reinforcements under the patch at the glue joints.

Much of the outside surface of a plywood aircraft is curved. 
If the damaged plywood skin has a radius of curvature not 
greater than 100 times the skin thickness, you can install 
a scarf patch. However, it may be necessary to soak or 
steam the patch, to preform it prior to gluing it in place. 
Shape backing blocks or other reinforcements to fit the  
skin curvature.

You can make scarf cuts in plywood with various tools, such 
as a hand plane, spoke shave, a sharp scraper, or sanding 
block. Sawn or roughly filed surfaces are not recommended 
because they are normally inaccurate and do not form the

When the back of a damaged plywood skin is accessible, 
such as a fuselage skin, repair it with scarf patches cut and 
installed with the grain parallel to the surface skin. Details 
for this type of repair are shown in Figure 6-33.

Figure 6-33, Section A-A, shows methods of support for a 
scarf between frame members using permanent backing and

gussets. When the damage follows or extends to a framing 
member, support the scarf as shown in section B-B. When 
the scarf does not quite extend to a frame member, support 
the patch as shown in section C-C. 

Damage that does not exceed 25 times the skin thickness 
(31⁄8-inches for 1⁄8-inch thick skin) after being trimmed to 
a circular shape can be repaired as shown in section D-D, 
provided the trimmed opening is not nearer than 15 times 
the skin thickness to a frame member (17⁄8-inches for 1⁄8-inch 
thick skin). 

A temporary backing block is carefully shaped from solid 
wood and fitted to the inside surface of the skin. A piece of 
waxed paper or plastic wrap is placed between the block 
and the underside of the skin. The scarf patch is installed 
and temporarily attached to the backing block, being held 
together in place with nailing strips. When the glue sets, 
remove the nails and block, leaving a flush surface on both 
sides of the repaired skin.

The Back of the Skin Is Not Accessible for Repair
To repair a section of the skin with a scarf patch when access 
to the back side is not possible, use the following steps to 
facilitate a repair, as shown in Figure 6-34.

Cut out and remove the damaged section. Carefully mark 
and cut the scarf around the perimeter of the hole. Working 
through the cutout, install backing strips along all edges that 
are not fully backed by a rib or spar. To prevent warping of 
the skin, fabricate backing strips from soft-textured plywood, 
such as yellow poplar or spruce, rather than a piece of  
solid wood. 

Use nailing strips to hold backing strips in place while the 
glue sets. Use a bucking bar, where necessary, to provide 
support for nailing. A saddle gusset of plywood should 
support the end of the backing strip at all junctions between 
the backing strips and ribs or spars.  If needed, nail and bond 
the new gusset plate to the rib or spar. It may be necessary 
to remove and replace an old gusset plate with a new saddle 
gusset, or nail a new gusset over the original.

Unlike some of the other type patches that are glued and 
installed as one process, this repair must wait for the glue to 
set on the backing strips and gussets. At that point, the scarf 
patch can be cut and fit to match the grain, and glued, using 
weight for pressure on the patch as appropriate. When dry, 
fill and finish the repair to match the original surface.

Advanced Composite Materials
Description of Composite Structures
Introduction
Composite materials are becoming more important in the 
construction of aerospace structures. Aircraft parts made 
from composite materials, such as fairings, spoilers, and flight 
controls, were developed during the 1960s for their weight 
savings over aluminum parts. New generation large aircraft 
are designed with all composite fuselage and wing structures, 
and the repair of these advanced composite materials requires 
an in-depth knowledge of composite structures, materials, 
and tooling. The primary advantages of composite materials 
are their high strength, relatively low weight, and corrosion 
resistance.


7-2

Laminated Structures
Composite materials consist of a combination of materials that 
are mixed together to achieve specific structural properties. 
The individual materials do not dissolve or merge completely 
in the composite, but they act together as one. Normally, the 
components can be physically identified as they interface 
with one another. The properties of the composite material 
are superior to the properties of the individual materials from 
which it is constructed.

An advanced composite material is made of a fibrous material 
embedded in a resin matrix, generally laminated with fibers 
oriented in alternating directions to give the material strength 
and stiffness. Fibrous materials are not new; wood is the most 
common fibrous structural material known to man.

Applications of composites on aircraft include: 

• Fairings

• Flight control surfaces

• Landing gear doors

• Leading and trailing edge panels on the wing and 
stabilizer

• Interior components

• Floor beams and floor boards

• Vertical and horizontal stabilizer primary structure on 
large aircraft

• Primary wing and fuselage structure on new generation 
large aircraft

• Turbine engine fan blades

• Propellers

 
Major Components of a Laminate
An isotropic material has uniform properties in all directions. 
The measured properties of an isotropic material are 
independent of the axis of testing. Metals such as aluminum 
and titanium are examples of isotropic materials.

A fiber is the primary load carrying element of the composite 
material. The composite material is only strong and stiff in 
the direction of the fibers. Unidirectional composites have 
predominant mechanical properties in one direction and are 
said to be anisotropic, having mechanical and/or physical 
properties that vary with direction relative to natural reference 
axes inherent in the material. Components made from fiber-
reinforced composites can be designed so that the fiber 
orientation produces optimum mechanical properties, but 
they can only approach the true isotropic nature of metals, 
such as aluminum and titanium.

A matrix supports the fibers and bonds them together in the 
composite material. The matrix transfers any applied loads 
to the fibers, keeps the fibers in their position and chosen 
orientation, gives the composite environmental resistance, and 
determines the maximum service temperature of a composite.

Strength Characteristics
Structural properties, such as stiffness, dimensional stability, 
and strength of a composite laminate, depend on the stacking 
sequence of the plies. The stacking sequence describes 
the distribution of ply orientations through the laminate 
thickness. As the number of plies with chosen orientations 
increases, more stacking sequences are possible. For 
example, a symmetric eight-ply laminate with four different 
ply orientations has 24 different stacking sequences.

Fiber Orientation 
The strength and stiffness of a composite buildup depends 
on the orientation sequence of the plies. The practical range 
of strength and stiffness of carbon fiber extends from values 
as low as those provided by fiberglass to as high as those 
provided by titanium. This range of values is determined 
by the orientation of the plies to the applied load. Proper 
selection of ply orientation in advanced composite materials 
is necessary to provide a structurally efficient design. The 
part might require 0° plies to react to axial loads, ±45° plies 
to react to shear loads, and 90° plies to react to side loads. 
Because the strength design requirements are a function of 
the applied load direction, ply orientation and ply sequence 
have to be correct. It is critical during a repair to replace 
each damaged ply with a ply of the same material and ply 
orientation.

The fibers in a unidirectional material run in one direction 
and the strength and stiffness is only in the direction of the 
fiber. Pre-impregnated (prepreg) tape is an example of a 
unidirectional ply orientation.

The fibers in a bidirectional material run in two directions, 
typically 90° apart. A plain weave fabric is an example of 
a bidirectional ply orientation. These ply orientations have 
strength in both directions but not necessarily the same 
strength. [Figure 7-1]

The plies of a quasi-isotropic layup are stacked in a 0°, –45°, 
45°, and 90° sequence or in a 0°, –60°, and 60° sequence. 
[Figure 7-2] These types of ply orientation simulate 
the properties of an isotropic material. Many aerospace 
composite structures are made of quasi-isotropic materials.

Figure 7-2. Quasi-isotropic material layup.

Figure 7-3. A warp clock.

Warp Clock
Warp indicates the longitudinal fibers of a fabric. The warp 
is the high strength direction due to the straightness of the 
fibers. A warp clock is used to describe direction of fibers 
on a diagram, spec sheet, or manufacturer’s sheets. If the 
warp clock is not available on the fabric, the orientation is 
defaulted to zero as the fabric comes off the roll. Therefore, 
90° to zero is the width of the fabric across. [Figure 7-3]

Fiber Forms
All product forms generally begin with spooled unidirectional 
raw fibers packaged as continuous strands. An individual fiber 
is called a filament. The word strand is also used to identify 
an individual glass fiber. Bundles of filaments are identified 
as tows, yarns, or rovings. Fiberglass yarns are twisted, while 
Kevlar® yarns are not. Tows and rovings do not have any 
twist. Most fibers are available as dry fiber that needs to 
be impregnated (impreg) with a resin before use or prepreg 
materials where the resin is already applied to the fiber.

Roving 
A roving is a single grouping of filament or fiber ends, such 
as 20-end or 60-end glass rovings. All filaments are in the 
same direction and they are not twisted. Carbon rovings are 
usually identified as 3K, 6K, or 12K rovings, K meaning 
1,000 filaments. Most applications for roving products utilize 
mandrels for filament winding and then resin cure to final 
configuration. 

Unidirectional (Tape) 
Unidirectional prepreg tapes have been the standard within 
the aerospace industry for many years, and the fiber is 
typically impregnated with thermosetting resins. The most 
common method of manufacture is to draw collimated raw 
(dry) strands into the impregnation machine where hot melted 
resins are combined with the strands using heat and pressure. 
Tape products have high strength in the fiber direction and 
virtually no strength across the fibers. The fibers are held in 
place by the resin. Tapes have a higher strength than woven 
fabrics. [Figure 7-4]

Bidirectional (Fabric)
Most fabric constructions offer more flexibility for layup 
of complex shapes than straight unidirectional tapes offer. 
Fabrics offer the option for resin impregnation either by 
solution or the hot melt process. Generally, fabrics used 
for structural applications use like fibers or strands of 
the same weight or yield in both the warp (longitudinal) 
and fill (transverse) directions. For aerospace structures, 
tightly woven fabrics are usually the choice to save weight, 
minimizing resin void size, and maintaining fiber orientation 
during the fabrication process.

Tape Fabric

Figure 7-4. Tape and fabric products.

Woven structural fabrics are usually constructed with 
reinforcement tows, strands, or yarns interlocking upon 
themselves with over/under placement during the weaving 
process. The more common fabric styles are plain or satin 
weaves. The plain weave construction results from each 
fiber alternating over and then under each intersecting strand 
(tow, bundle, or yarn). With the common satin weaves, such 
as 5 harness or 8 harness, the fiber bundles traverse both in 
warp and fill directions changing over/under position less 
frequently. 

These satin weaves have less crimp and are easier to distort 
than a plain weave. With plain weave fabrics and most 5 
or 8 harness woven fabrics, the fiber strand count is equal 
in both warp and fill directions. For example, 3K plain 
weave often has an additional designation, such as 12 x 12, 
meaning there are twelve tows per inch in each direction. 
This count designation can be varied to increase or decrease 
fabric weight or to accommodate different fibers of varying 
weight. [Figure 7-5]

Nonwoven (Knitted or Stitched) 
Knitted or stitched fabrics can offer many of the mechanical 
advantages of unidirectional tapes. Fiber placement can be 
straight or unidirectional without the over/under turns of 
woven fabrics. The fibers are held in place by stitching with 
fine yarns or threads after preselected orientations of one or 
more layers of dry plies. These types of fabrics offer a wide 
range of multi-ply orientations. Although there may be some 
added weight penalties or loss of some ultimate reinforcement 
fiber properties, some gain of interlaminar shear and toughness 
properties may be realized. Some common stitching yarns are 
polyester, aramid, or thermoplastics. [Figure 7-6]

Types of Fiber
Fiberglass
Fiberglass is often used for secondary structure on aircraft, 
such as fairings, radomes, and wing tips. Fiberglass is also 
used for helicopter rotor blades. There are several types of 
fiberglass used in the aviation industry. Electrical glass, or 
E-glass, is identified as such for electrical applications. It 
has high resistance to current flow. E-glass is made from 
borosilicate glass. S-glass and S2-glass identify structural 
fiberglass that have a higher strength than E-glass. S-glass 
is produced from magnesia-alumina-silicate. Advantages 
of fiberglass are lower cost than other composite materials, 
chemical or galvanic corrosion resistance, and electrical 
properties (fiberglass does not conduct electricity). Fiberglass 
has a white color and is available as a dry fiber fabric or 
prepreg material.

Kevlar®

Kevlar® is DuPont’s name for aramid fibers. Aramid fibers 
are light weight, strong, and tough. Two types of aramid 
fiber are used in the aviation industry. Kevlar® 49 has a high 
stiffness and Kevlar® 29 has a low stiffness. An advantage 
of aramid fibers is their high resistance to impact damage, so 
they are often used in areas prone to impact damage. The main 
disadvantage of aramid fibers is their general weakness in 
compression and hygroscopy. Service reports have indicated 
that some parts made from Kevlar® absorb up to 8 percent 
of their weight in water. Therefore, parts made from aramid 
fibers need to be protected from the environment. Another 
disadvantage is that Kevlar® is difficult to drill and cut. The 
fibers fuzz easily and special scissors are needed to cut the

material. Kevlar® is often used for military ballistic and 
body armor applications. It has a natural yellow color and 
is available as dry fabric and prepreg material. Bundles of 
aramid fibers are not sized by the number of fibers like carbon 
or fiberglass but by the weight.

Carbon/Graphite
One of the first distinctions to be made among fibers is the 
difference between carbon and graphite fibers, although 
the terms are frequently used interchangeably. Carbon and 
graphite fibers are based on graphene (hexagonal) layer

material (right). Figure 7-8. Copper mesh lightning protection material.

networks present in carbon. If the graphene layers, or planes, 
are stacked with three dimensional order, the material is 
defined as graphite. Usually extended time and temperature 
processing is required to form this order, making graphite 
fibers more expensive. Bonding between planes is weak. 
Disorder frequently occurs such that only two-dimensional 
ordering within the layers is present. This material is defined 
as carbon.

Carbon fibers are very stiff and strong, 3 to 10 times stiffer 
than glass fibers. Carbon fiber is used for structural aircraft 
applications, such as floor beams, stabilizers, flight controls, 
and primary fuselage and wing structure. Advantages include 
its high strength and corrosion resistance. Disadvantages 
include lower conductivity than aluminum; therefore, a 
lightning protection mesh or coating is necessary for aircraft 
parts that are prone to lightning strikes. Another disadvantage 
of carbon fiber is its high cost. Carbon fiber is gray or black 
in color and is available as dry fabric and prepreg material. 
Carbon fibers have a high potential for causing galvanic 
corrosion when used with metallic fasteners and structures. 
[Figure 7-7]

Boron
Boron fibers are very stiff and have a high tensile and 
compressive strength. The fibers have a relatively large 
diameter and do not flex well; therefore, they are available 
only as a prepreg tape product. An epoxy matrix is often used 
with the boron fiber. Boron fibers are used to repair cracked 
aluminum aircraft skins, because the thermal expansion of 
boron is close to aluminum and there is no galvanic corrosion 
potential. The boron fiber is difficult to use if the parent 
material surface has a contoured shape. The boron fibers are 
very expensive and can be hazardous for personnel. Boron 
fibers are used primarily in military aviation applications.

Ceramic Fibers
Ceramic fibers are used for high-temperature applications, 
such as turbine blades in a gas turbine engine. The ceramic 
fibers can be used to temperatures up to 2,200 °F. 

Lightning Protection Fibers
An aluminum airplane is quite conductive and is able to 
dissipate the high currents resulting from a lightning strike. 
Carbon fibers are 1,000 times more resistive than aluminum 
to current flow, and epoxy resin is 1,000,000 times more 
resistive (i.e., perpendicular to the skin). The surface of an 
external composite component often consists of a ply or layer 
of conductive material for lightning strike protection because 
composite materials are less conductive than aluminum. 
Many different types of conductive materials are used 
ranging from nickel-coated graphite cloth to metal meshes 
to aluminized fiberglass to conductive paints. The materials 
are available for wet layup and as prepreg. 

In addition to a normal structural repair, the technician must 
also recreate the electrical conductivity designed into the 
part. These types of repair generally require a conductivity 
test to be performed with an ohmmeter to verify minimum 
electrical resistance across the structure. When repairing 
these types of structures, it is extremely important to use only 
the approved materials from authorized vendors, including 
such items as potting compounds, sealants, adhesives, and 
so forth. [Figures 7-8 and 7-9]

Matrix Materials
Thermosetting Resins
Resin is a generic term used to designate the polymer. The 
resin, its chemical composition, and physical properties 
fundamentally affect the processing, fabrication, and 


7-7

Figure 7-9. Aluminum mesh lightning protection material.

Figure 7-10. Two-part wet layup epoxy resin system with pump 
dispenser. 

ultimate properties of a composite material. Thermosetting 
resins are the most diverse and widely used of all man-made 
materials. They are easily poured or formed into any shape, 
are compatible with most other materials, and cure readily 
(by heat or catalyst) into an insoluble solid.  Thermosetting 
resins are also excellent adhesives and bonding agents.

Polyester Resins

Polyester resins are relatively inexpensive, fast processing 
resins used generally for low cost applications. Low smoke 
producing polyester resins are used for interior parts of 
the aircraft. Fiber-reinforced polyesters can be processed 
by many methods. Common processing methods include 
matched metal molding, wet layup, press (vacuum bag) 
molding, injection molding, filament winding, pultrusion, 
and autoclaving.

Vinyl Ester Resin

The appearance, handling properties, and curing characteristics 
of vinyl ester resins are the same as those of conventional 
polyester resins. However, the corrosion resistance and 
mechanical properties of vinyl ester composites are much 
improved over standard polyester resin composites.

Phenolic Resin

Phenol-formaldehyde resins were first produced commercially 
in the early 1900s for use in the commercial market. Urea-
formaldehyde and melamine-formaldehyde appeared in 
the 1920–1930s as a less expensive alternative for lower 
temperature use. Phenolic resins are used for interior 
components because of their low smoke and flammability 
characteristics.

Epoxy

Epoxies are polymerizable thermosetting resins and are 
available in a variety of viscosities from liquid to solid. 
There are many different types of epoxy, and the technician 
should use the maintenance manual to select the correct type 
for a specific repair. Epoxies are used widely in resins for 
prepreg materials and structural adhesives. The advantages of 
epoxies are high strength and modulus, low levels of volatiles, 
excellent adhesion, low shrinkage, good chemical resistance, 
and ease of processing. Their major disadvantages are 
brittleness and the reduction of properties in the presence of 
moisture. The processing or curing of epoxies is slower than 
polyester resins. Processing techniques include autoclave 
molding, filament winding, press molding, vacuum bag 
molding, resin transfer molding, and pultrusion. Curing 
temperatures vary from room temperature to approximately 
350 °F (180 °C). The most common cure temperatures range 
between 250° and 350 °F (120–180 °C). [Figure 7-10]

Polyimides

Polyimide resins excel in high-temperature environments 
where their thermal resistance, oxidative stability, low 
coefficient of thermal expansion, and solvent resistance 
benefit the design. Their primary uses are circuit boards 
and hot engine and airframe structures. A polyimide may be 
either a thermoset resin or a thermoplastic. Polyimides require 
high cure temperatures, usually in excess of 550 °F (290 °C). 
Consequently, normal epoxy composite bagging materials are 
not usable, and steel tooling becomes a necessity. Polyimide 
bagging and release films, such as Kapton® are used. It is 
extremely important that Upilex® replace the lower cost 
nylon bagging and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) release 
films common to epoxy composite processing. Fiberglass 
fabrics must be used for bleeder and breather materials 


7-8

instead of polyester mat materials due to the low melting 
point of polyester.

Polybenzimidazoles (PBI)

Polybenzimidazole resin is extremely high temperature 
resistant and is used for high-temperature materials. These 
resins are available as adhesive and fiber. 

Bismaleimides (BMI)

Bismaleimide resins have a higher temperature capability 
and higher toughness than epoxy resins, and they provide 
excellent performance at ambient and elevated temperatures. 
The processing of bismaleimide resins is similar to that 
for epoxy resins. BMIs are used for aero engines and high 
temperature components. BMIs are suitable for standard 
autoclave processing, injection molding, resin transfer 
molding, and sheet molded compound (SMC) among others. 

Thermoplastic Resins
Thermoplastic materials can be softened repeatedly by 
an increase of temperature and hardened by a decrease in 
temperature. Processing speed is the primary advantage of 
thermoplastic materials. Chemical curing of the material 
does not take place during processing, and the material can 
be shaped by molding or extrusion when it is soft.

Semicrystalline Thermoplastics

Semicrystalline thermoplastics possess properties of inherent 
flame resistance, superior toughness, good mechanical 
properties at elevated temperatures and after impact, and 
low moisture absorption. They are used in secondary and 
primary aircraft structures. Combined with reinforcing 
fibers, they are available in injection molding compounds, 
compression-moldable random sheets, unidirectional tapes, 
prepregs fabricated from tow (towpreg), and woven prepregs. 
Fibers impregnated in semicrystalline thermoplastics 
include carbon, nickel-coated carbon, aramid, glass, quartz,  
and others. 

Amorphous Thermoplastics

Amorphous thermoplastics are available in several physical 
forms, including films, filaments, and powders. Combined 
with reinforcing fibers, they are also available in injection 
molding compounds, compressive moldable random sheets, 
unidirectional tapes, woven prepregs, etc. The fibers used are 
primarily carbon, aramid, and glass. The specific advantages 
of amorphous thermoplastics depend upon the polymer. 
Typically, the resins are noted for their processing ease 
and speed, high temperature capability, good mechanical 
properties, excellent toughness and impact strength, 
and chemical stability. The stability results in unlimited 
shelf life, eliminating the cold storage requirements of  
thermoset prepregs.

Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) 

Polyether ether ketone, better known as PEEK, is a high-
temperature thermoplastic. This aromatic ketone material 
offers outstanding thermal and combustion characteristics 
and resistance to a wide range of solvents and proprietary 
fluids. PEEK can also be reinforced with glass and carbon.

Curing Stages of Resins
Thermosetting resins use a chemical reaction to cure. There 
are three curing stages, which are called A, B, and C. 

• A stage: The components of the resin (base material 
and hardener) have been mixed but the chemical 
reaction has not started. The resin is in the A stage 
during a wet layup procedure.

• B stage: The components of the resin have been mixed 
and the chemical reaction has started. The material has 
thickened and is tacky. The resins of prepreg materials 
are in the B stage. To prevent further curing the resin 
is placed in a freezer at 0 °F. In the frozen state, the 
resin of the prepreg material stays in the B stage. The 
curing starts when the material is removed from the 
freezer and warmed again.

• C stage: The resin is fully cured. Some resins cure 
at room temperature and others need an elevated 
temperature cure cycle to fully cure.

Prepreg material consists of a combination of a matrix and 
fiber reinforcement. It is available in unidirectional form 
(one direction of reinforcement) and fabric form (several 
directions of reinforcement). All five of the major families of 
matrix resins can be used to impregnate various fiber forms. 
The resin is then no longer in a low-viscosity stage, but has 
been advanced to a B stage level of cure for better handling 
characteristics. The following products are available in 
prepreg form: unidirectional tapes, woven fabrics, continuous 
strand rovings, and chopped mat. Prepreg materials must be 
stored in a freezer at a temperature below 0 °F to retard the 
curing process. Prepreg materials are cured with an elevated 
temperature. Many prepreg materials used in aerospace 
are impregnated with an epoxy resin and they are cured at 
either 250 °F or 350 °F. Prepreg materials are cured with an 
autoclave, oven, or heat blanket. They are typically purchased 
and stored on a roll in a sealed plastic bag to avoid moisture 
contamination. [Figure 7-11] 

Dry Fiber Material
Dry fiber materials, such as carbon, glass, and Kevlar® are 
used for many aircraft repair procedures. The dry fabric is 
impregnated with a resin just before the repair work starts. 
This process is often called wet layup. The main advantage 
of using the wet layup process is that the fiber and resin can

be stored for a long time at room temperature. The composite 
can be cured at room temperature or an elevated temperature 
cure can be used to speed up the curing process and increase 
the strength. The disadvantage is that the process is messy 
and  reinforcement properties are less than prepreg material 
properties. [Figure 7-12]

Thixotropic Agents
Thixotropic agents are gel-like at rest but become fluid when 
agitated. These materials have high static shear strength and 
low dynamic shear strength at the same time to lose viscosity 
under stress.

Adhesives
Film Adhesives
Structural adhesives for aerospace applications are generally 
supplied as thin films supported on a release paper and 
stored under refrigerated conditions (–18 °C, or 0 °F). Film 
adhesives are available using high-temperature aromatic 

amine or catalytic curing agents with a wide range of 
flexibilizing and toughening agents. Rubber-toughened 
epoxy film adhesives are widely used in aircraft industry. 
The upper temperature limit of 121–177 °C (250–350 °F) 
is usually dictated by the degree of toughening required 
and by the overall choice of resins and curing agents. In 
general, toughening of a resin results in a lower usable 
service temperature. Film materials are frequently supported 
by fibers that serve to improve handling of the films prior 
to cure, control adhesive flow during bonding, and assist in 
bond line thickness control. Fibers can be incorporated as 
short-fiber mats with random orientation or as woven cloth. 
Commonly encountered fibers are polyesters, polyamides 
(nylon), and glass. Adhesives containing woven cloth may 
have slightly degraded environmental properties because of 
wicking of water by the fiber. Random mat scrim cloth is 
not as efficient for controlling film thickness as woven cloth 
because the unrestricted fibers move during bonding. Spun-
bonded nonwoven scrims do not move and are, therefore, 
widely used. [Figures 7-13 and 7-14] 

Paste Adhesives
Paste adhesives are used as an alternative to film adhesive. 
These are often used to secondary bond repair patches to 
damaged parts and also used in places where film adhesive 
is difficult to apply. Paste adhesives for structural bonding 
are made mostly from epoxy. One part and two part systems 
are available. The advantages of paste adhesives are that they 
can be stored at room temperature and have a long shelf life. 
The disadvantage is that the bondline thickness is hard to 
control, which affects the strength of the bond. A scrim cloth
can be used to maintain adhesive in the bondline when 
bonding patches with paste adhesive. [Figure 7-15]

Foaming Adhesives
Most foaming adhesives are 0.025-inch to 0.10-inch thick 
sheets of B staged epoxy. Foam adhesives cure at 250 °F or 
350 °F. During the cure cycle, the foaming adhesives expand. 
Foaming adhesives need to be stored in the freezer just like 
prepregs, and they have only a limited storage life. Foaming 
adhesives are used to splice pieces of honeycomb together 
in a sandwich construction and to bond repair plugs to the 
existing core during a prepreg repair. [Figure 7-16]

Description of Sandwich Structures
Theory A sandwich construction is a structural panel concept 
that consists in its simplest form of two relatively thin, 
parallel face sheets bonded to and separated by a relatively 
thick, lightweight core. The core supports the face sheets 
against buckling and resists out-of-plane shear loads. The 
core must have high shear strength and compression stiffness. 
Composite sandwich construction is most often fabricated 
using autoclave cure, press cure, or vacuum bag cure. Skin

laminates may be precured and subsequently bonded to core, 
co-cured to core in one operation, or a combination of the 
two methods. Examples of honeycomb structure are: wing 
spoilers, fairings, ailerons, flaps, nacelles, floor boards, and 
rudders. [Figure 7-17]

Properties
Sandwich construction has high bending stiffness at 
minimal weight in comparison to aluminum and composite 
laminate construction. Most honeycombs are anisotropic; 
that is, properties are directional. Figure 7-18 illustrates 
the advantages of using a honeycomb construction. 
Increasing the core thickness greatly increases the stiffness 
of the honeycomb construction, while the weight increase 
is minimal. Due to the high stiffness of a honeycomb 
construction, it is not necessary to use external stiffeners, 
such as stringers and frames. [Figure 7-18]

Facing Materials
Most honeycomb structures used in aircraft construction have 
aluminum, fiberglass, Kevlar®, or carbon fiber face sheets. 
Carbon fiber face sheets cannot be used with aluminum 
honeycomb core material, because it causes the aluminum to 
corrode. Titanium and steel are used for specialty applications 
in high-temperature constructions. The face sheets of many 
components, such as spoilers and flight controls, are very 
thin—sometimes only 3 or 4 plies. Field reports have 
indicated that these face sheets do not have a good impact 
resistance.

Core Materials
Honeycomb
Each honeycomb material provides certain properties and 
has specific benefits. [Figure 7-19] The most common core 
material used for aircraft honeycomb structures is aramid 
paper (Nomex® or Korex®). Fiberglass is used for higher 
strength applications. 

• Kraft paper—relatively low strength, good insulating 
properties, is available in large quantities, and has a 
low cost.

Hexagonal Honeycomb Core

Overexpanded Core

Flexicore

Figure 7-20. Honeycomb density.

• Thermoplastics—good insulating properties, good 
energy absorption and/or redirection, smooth 
cell walls, moisture and chemical resistance, are 
environmentally compatible, aesthetically pleasing, 
and have a relatively low cost.

• Aluminum—best strength-to-weight ratio and 
energy absorption, has good heat transfer properties, 
electromagnetic shielding properties, has smooth, thin 
cell walls, is machinable, and has a relatively low cost.

• Steel—good heat transfer properties, electromagnetic 
shielding properties, and heat resistant.

• Specialty metals (titanium)—relatively high strength-
to-weight ratio, good heat transfer properties, chemical 
resistance, and heat resistant to very high temperatures.

• Aramid paper—flame resistant, fire retardant, good 
insulating properties, low dielectric properties, and 
good formability.

• Fiberglass—tailorable shear properties by layup, low 
dielectric properties, good insulating properties, and 
good formability.

• Carbon—good dimensional stability and retention, 
high-temperature property retention, high stiffness, 
very low coefficient of thermal expansion, tailorable 
thermal conductivity, relatively high shear modulus, 
and very expensive.

• Ceramics—heat resistant to very high temperatures, 
good insulating properties, is available in very small 
cell sizes, and very expensive. [Figure 7-19] 

Honeycomb core cells for aerospace applications are usually 
hexagonal. The cells are made by bonding stacked sheets 
at special locations. The stacked sheets are expanded to 
form hexagons. The direction parallel to the sheets is called  
ribbon direction.

Bisected hexagonal core has another sheet of material cutting 
across each hexagon. Bisected hexagonal honeycomb is 
stiffer and stronger than hexagonal core. Overexpanded core 
is made by expanding the sheets more than is needed to make 
hexagons. The cells of overexpanded core are rectangular. 
Overexpanded core is flexible perpendicular to the ribbon 
direction and is used in panels with simple curves. Bell-
shaped core, or flexicore, has curved cell walls, that make it 
flexible in all directions. Bell-shaped core is used in panels 
with complex curves.

Honeycomb core is available with different cell sizes. 
Small sizes provide better support for sandwich face sheets. 
Honeycomb is also available in different densities. Higher 
density core is stronger and stiffer than lower density core. 
[Figure 7-20] 

Foam
Foam cores are used on homebuilts and lighter aircraft to 
give strength and shape to wing tips, flight controls, fuselage 
sections, wings, and wing ribs. Foam cores are not commonly 
used on commercial type aircraft. Foams are typically heavier 
than honeycomb and not as strong. A variety of foams can 
be used as core material including: 

• Polystyrene (better known as styrofoam)—aircraft 
grade styrofoam with a tightly closed cell structure 
and no voids between cells; high compressive strength 
and good resistance to water penetration; can be cut 
with a hot wire to make airfoil shapes. 


7-13

• Phenolic—very good fire-resistant properties and can 
have very low density, but relatively low mechanical 
properties.

• Polyurethane—used for producing the fuselage, wing 
tips, and other curved parts of small aircraft; relatively 
inexpensive, fuel resistant, and compatible with most 
adhesives; do not use a hot wire to cut polyurethane 
foam;  easily contoured with a large knife and sanding 
equipment.

• Polypropylene—used to make airfoil shapes; can be 
cut with a hot wire; compatible with most adhesives 
and epoxy resins; not for use with polyester resins, 
dissolves in fuels and solvents.

• Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Divinycell, Klegecell, 
and Airex)—a closed cell medium- to high-density 
foam with high compression strength, durability, and 
excellent fire resistance; can be vacuum formed to 
compound shapes and be bent using heat; compatible 
with polyester, vinyl ester, and epoxy resins.

• Polymethacrylimide (Rohacell)—a closed-cell foam 
used for lightweight sandwich construction; excellent 
mechanical properties, high-dimensional stability 
under heat, good solvent resistance, and outstanding 
creep compression resistance; more expensive than 
the other types of foams, but has greater mechanical 
properties.

Balsa Wood
Balsa is a natural wood product with elongated closed cells; 
it is available in a variety of grades that correlate to the 
structural, cosmetic, and physical characteristics. The density 
of balsa is less than one-half of the density of conventional 
wood products. However, balsa has a considerably higher 
density than the other types of structural cores. 
 
Manufacturing and In-Service Damage
Manufacturing Defects
Manufacturing defects include:

• Delamination

• Resin starved areas

• Resin rich areas

• Blisters, air bubbles

• Wrinkles

• Voids

• Thermal decomposition

Manufacturing damage includes anomalies, such as porosity, 
microcracking, and delaminations resulting from processing 
discrepancies. It also includes such items as inadvertent 

edge cuts, surface gouges and scratches, damaged fastener 
holes, and impact damage. Examples of flaws occurring 
in manufacturing include a contaminated bondline surface 
or inclusions, such as prepreg backing paper or separation 
film, that is inadvertently left between plies during layup. 
Inadvertent (nonprocess) damage can occur in detail parts or 
components during assembly or transport or during operation. 

A part is resin rich if too much resin is used, for nonstructural 
applications this is not necessarily bad, but it adds weight. A 
part is called resin starved if too much resin is bled off during 
the curing process or if not enough resin is applied during 
the wet layup process. Resin-starved areas are indicated by 
fibers that show to the surface. The ratio of 60:40 fiber to 
resin ratio is considered optimum. Sources of manufacturing 
defects include:

• Improper cure or processing

• Improper machining

• Mishandling

• Improper drilling

• Tool drops

• Contamination

• Improper sanding

• Substandard material

• Inadequate tooling

• Mislocation of holes or details

Damage can occur at several scales within the composite 
material and structural configuration. This ranges from 
damage in the matrix and fiber to broken elements and failure 
of bonded or bolted attachments. The extent of damage 
controls repeated load life and residual strength and is critical 
to damage tolerance.

Fiber Breakage
Fiber breakage can be critical because structures are typically 
designed to be fiber dominant (i.e., fibers carry most of the 
loads). Fortunately, fiber failure is typically limited to a zone 
near the point of impact and is constrained by the impact 
object size and energy. Only a few of the service-related 
events listed in the previous section could lead to large areas 
of fiber damage.

Matrix Imperfections 
Matrix imperfections usually occur on the matrix-fiber 
interface or in the matrix parallel to the fibers. These 
imperfections can slightly reduce some of the material 
properties but are seldom critical to the structure, unless the 
matrix degradation is widespread. Accumulation of matrix 


7-14

cracks can cause the degradation of matrix-dominated 
properties. For laminates designed to transmit loads with their 
fibers (fiber dominant), only a slight reduction of properties 
is observed when the matrix is severely damaged. Matrix 
cracks, or microcracks, can significantly reduce properties 
dependent on the resin or the fiber-resin interface, such 
as interlaminar shear and compression strength. Micro-
cracking can have a very negative effect on properties of 
high-temperature resins. Matrix imperfections may develop 
into delaminations, which are a more critical type of damage.

Delamination and Debonds
Delaminations form on the interface between the layers in the 
laminate. Delaminations may form from matrix cracks that 
grow into the interlaminar layer or from low-energy impact. 
Debonds can also form from production nonadhesion along 
the bondline between two elements and initiate delamination 
in adjacent laminate layers. Under certain conditions, 
delaminations or debonds can grow when subjected to 
repeated loading and can cause catastrophic failure when 
the laminate is loaded in compression. The criticality of 
delaminations or debonds depend on:

• Dimensions.

• Number of delaminations at a given location.

• Location—in the thickness of laminate, in the 
structure, proximity to free edges, stress concentration 
region, geometrical discontinuities, etc.

• Loads—behavior of delaminations and debonds 
depend on loading type. They have little effect 
on the response of laminates loaded in tension. 
Under compression or shear loading, however, 
the sublaminates adjacent to the delaminations or 
debonded elements may buckle and cause a load 
redistribution mechanism that leads to structural 
failure. 

Combinations of Damages
In general, impact events cause combinations of damages. 
High-energy impacts by large objects (e.g., turbine blades) 
may lead to broken elements and failed attachments. The 
resulting damage may include significant fiber failure, matrix 
cracking, delamination, broken fasteners, and debonded 
elements. Damage caused by low-energy impact is more 
contained, but may also include a combination of broken 
fibers, matrix cracks, and multiple delaminations. 

Flawed Fastener Holes
Improper hole drilling, poor fastener installation, and missing 
fasteners may occur in manufacturing. Hole elongation can 
occur due to repeated load cycling in service. 

In-Service Defects
In-service defects include:

• Environmental degradation

• Impact damage

• Fatigue

• Cracks from local overload

• Debonding

• Delamination

• Fiber fracturing

• Erosion

Many honeycomb structures, such as wing spoilers, fairings, 
flight controls, and landing gear doors, have thin face 
sheets which have experienced durability problems that 
could be grouped into three categories: low resistance to 
impact, liquid ingression, and erosion. These structures have 
adequate stiffness and strength but low resistance to a service 
environment in which parts are crawled over, tools dropped, 
and service personnel are often unaware of the fragility of 
thin-skinned sandwich parts. Damages to these components, 
such as core crush, impact damages, and disbonds, are quite 
often easy to detect with a visual inspection due to their 
thin face sheets. However, they are sometimes overlooked 
or damaged by service personnel who do not want to delay 
aircraft departure or bring attention to their accidents, which 
might reflect poorly on their performance record. Therefore, 
damages are sometimes allowed to go unchecked, often 
resulting in growth of the damage due to liquid ingression 
into the core. Nondurable design details (e.g., improper core 
edge close-outs) also lead to liquid ingression.

The repair of parts due to liquid ingression can vary 
depending on the liquid, most commonly water or Skydrol 
(hydraulic fluid). Water tends to create additional damage in 
repaired parts when cured unless all moisture is removed from 
the part. Most repair material systems cure at temperatures 
above the boiling point of water, which can cause a disbond 
at the skin-to-core interface wherever trapped water resides. 
For this reason, core drying cycles are typically included prior 
to performing any repair. Some operators take the extra step 
of placing a damaged but unrepaired part in the autoclave to 
dry to preclude any additional damage from occurring during 
the cure of the repair. Skydrol presents a different problem. 
Once the core of a sandwich part is saturated, complete 
removal of Skydrol is almost impossible. The part continues 
to weep the liquid even in cure until bondlines can become 
contaminated and full bonding does not occur. Removal of 
contaminated core and adhesive as part of the repair is highly 
recommended. [Figure 7-21]


7-15

Figure 7-21. Damage to radome honeycomb sandwich structure.

Figure 7-22. Erosion damage to wingtip.

Erosion capabilities of composite materials have been 
known to be less than that of aluminum and, as a result, 
their application in leading-edge surfaces has been generally 
avoided. However, composites have been used in areas of 
highly complex geometry, but generally with an erosion 
coating. The durability and maintainability of some erosion 
coatings are less than ideal. Another problem, not as obvious 
as the first, is that edges of doors or panels can erode if they 
are exposed to the air stream. This erosion can be attributed 
to improper design or installation/fit-up. On the other hand, 
metal structures in contact or in the vicinity of these composite 
parts may show corrosion damage due to inappropriate choice 
of aluminum alloy, damaged corrosion sealant of metal parts 
during assembly or at splices, or insufficient sealant and/or 
lack of glass fabric isolation plies at the interfaces of spars, 
ribs, and fittings. [Figure 7-22] 

Corrosion
Many fiberglass and Kevlar® parts have a fine aluminum 
mesh for lightning protection. This aluminum mesh often 
corrodes around the bolt or screw holes. The corrosion affects 
the electrical bonding of the panel, and the aluminum mesh 
needs to be removed and new mesh installed to restore the 
electrical bonding of the panel. [Figure 7-23]

Ultraviolet (UV) light affects the strength of composite 
materials. Composite structures need to be protected by a 
top coating to prevent the effects of UV light. Special UV 
primers and paints have been developed to protect composite 
materials.
 
Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) of 
Composites
Visual Inspection
A visual inspection is the primary inspection method for in-
service inspections. Most types of damage scorch, stain, dent, 
penetrate, abrade, or chip the composite surface, making the 
damage visible. Once damage is detected, the affected area 
needs to be inspected closer using flashlights, magnifying 
glasses, mirrors, and borescopes. These tools are used to 
magnify defects that otherwise might not be seen easily 
and to allow visual inspection of areas that are not readily 
accessible. Resin starvation, resin richness, wrinkles, ply 
bridging, discoloration (due to overheating, lightning strike, 
etc.), impact damage by any cause, foreign matter, blisters, 
and disbonding are some of the discrepancies that can be 
detected with a visual inspection. Visual inspection cannot 
find internal flaws in the composite, such as delaminations, 
disbonds, and matrix crazing. More sophisticated NDI 
techniques are needed to detect these types of defects.

Audible Sonic Testing (Coin Tapping) 
Sometimes referred to as audio, sonic, or coin tap, this 
technique makes use of frequencies in the audible range 
(10 Hz to 20 Hz). A surprisingly accurate method in the hands 
of experienced personnel, tap testing is perhaps the most 
common technique used for the detection of delamination 
and/or disbond. The method is accomplished by tapping 
the inspection area with a solid round disk or lightweight 
hammer-like device and listening to the response of the 
structure to the hammer. [Figure 7-24] A clear, sharp, ringing 
sound is indicative of a well-bonded solid structure, while a 
dull or thud-like sound indicates a discrepant area. 

The tapping rate needs to be rapid enough to produce enough 
sound for any difference in sound tone to be discernable to the 
ear. Tap testing is effective on thin skin to stiffener bondlines, 
honeycomb sandwich with thin face sheets, or even near  
the surface of thick laminates, such as rotorcraft blade  

supports. Again, inherent in the method is the possibility 
that changes within the internal elements of the structure 
might produce pitch changes that are interpreted as defects, 
when in fact they are present by design. This inspection 
should be accomplished in as quiet an area as possible and 
by experienced personnel familiar with the part’s internal 
configuration. This method is not reliable for structures with 
more than four plies. It is often used to map out the damage 
on thin honeycomb facesheets. [Figure 7-24]

Automated Tap Test
This test is very similar to the manual tap test except that a 
solenoid is used instead of a hammer. The solenoid produces 
multiple impacts in a single area. The tip of the impactor 
has a transducer that records the force versus time signal 
of the impactor. The magnitude of the force depends on the 
impactor, the impact energy, and the mechanical properties 
of the structure. The impact duration (period) is not sensitive

to the magnitude of the impact force; however, this duration 
changes as the stiffness of the structure is altered. Therefore, 
the signal from an unflawed region is used for calibration, 
and any deviation from this unflawed signal indicates the 
existence of damage. 
 
Ultrasonic Inspection
Ultrasonic inspection has proven to be a very useful tool 
for the detection of internal delaminations, voids, or 
inconsistencies in composite components not otherwise 
discernable using visual or tap methodology. There are many 
ultrasonic techniques; however, each technique uses sound 
wave energy with a frequency above the audible range. 
[Figure 7-25] A high-frequency (usually several MHz) sound 
wave is introduced into the part and may be directed to travel 
normal to the part surface, or along the surface of the part, or 
at some predefined angle to the part surface. You may need 
to try different directions to locate the flow. The introduced 
sound is then monitored as it travels its assigned route through 
the part for any significant change. Ultrasonic sound waves 
have properties similar to light waves. When an ultrasonic 
wave strikes an interrupting object, the wave or energy is 
either absorbed or reflected back to the surface. The disrupted 
or diminished sonic energy is then picked up by a receiving 
transducer and converted into a display on an oscilloscope or 
a chart recorder. The display allows the operator to evaluate 

the discrepant indications comparatively with those areas 
known to be good. To facilitate the comparison, reference 
standards are established and utilized to calibrate the 
ultrasonic equipment. 

The repair technician must realize that the concepts outlined 
here work fine in the repetitious manufacturing environment, 
but are likely to be more difficult to implement in a repair 
environment given the vast number of different composite 
components installed on the aircraft and the relative 
complexity of their construction. The reference standards 
would also have to take into account the transmutations that 
take place when a composite component is exposed to an 
in-service environment over a prolonged period or has been 
the subject of repair activity or similar restorative action. The 
four most common ultrasonic techniques are discussed next.

Through Transmission Ultrasonic Inspection
Through transmission ultrasonic inspection uses two 
transducers, one on each side of the area to be inspected. The 
ultrasonic signal is transmitted from one transducer to the 
other transducer. The loss of signal strength is then measured 
by the instrument. The instrument shows the loss as a percent 
of the original signal strength or the loss in decibels. The signal 
loss is compared to a reference standard. Areas with a greater 
loss than the reference standard indicate a defective area.

Figure 7-28. Phased array testing equipment.

Pulse Echo Ultrasonic Inspection
Single-side ultrasonic inspection may be accomplished using 
pulse echo techniques. In this method, a single search unit is 
working as a transmitting and a receiving transducer that is 
excited by high voltage pulses. Each electrical pulse activates 
the transducer element. This element converts the electrical 
energy into mechanical energy in the form of an ultrasonic 
sound wave. The sonic energy travels through a Teflon® or 
methacrylate contact tip into the test part. A waveform is 
generated in the test part and is picked up by the transducer 
element. Any change in amplitude of the received signal, 
or time required for the echo to return to the transducer, 
indicates the presence of a defect. Pulse echo inspections 
are used to find delaminations, cracks, porosity, water, and 
disbonds of bonded components. Pulse echo does not find 
disbonds or defects between laminated skins and honeycomb 
core. [Figure 7-26]

Ultrasonic Bondtester Inspection
Low-frequency and high-frequency bondtesters are used 
for ultrasonic inspections of composite structures. These 
bondtesters use an inspection probe that has one or two 
transducers. The high-frequency bondtester is used to 
detect delaminations and voids. It cannot detect a skin-to-
honeycomb core disbond or porosity. It can detect defects as 
small as 0.5-inch in diameter. The low-frequency bondtester 
uses two transducers and is used to detect delamination, 
voids, and skin to honeycomb core disbands. This inspection 
method does not detect which side of the part is damaged, and 
cannot detect defects smaller than 1.0-inch. [Figure 7-27]

Phased Array Inspection
Phased array inspection is one of the latest ultrasonic 
instruments to detect flaws in composite structures. It 
operates under the same principle of operation as pulse echo, 
but it uses 64 sensors at the same time, which speeds up the 
process. [Figure 7-28]

Radiography
Radiography, often referred to as X-ray, is a very useful 
NDI method because it essentially allows a view into the 
interior of the part. This inspection method is accomplished 
by passing X-rays through the part or assembly being tested 
while recording the absorption of the rays onto a film sensitive 


7-19

to X-rays. The exposed film, when developed, allows the 
inspector to analyze variations in the opacity of the exposure 
recorded onto the film, in effect creating a visualization of 
the relationship of the component’s internal details. Since the 
method records changes in total density through its thickness, 
it is not a preferred method for detecting defects such as 
delaminations that are in a plane that is normal to the ray 
direction. It is a most effective method, however, for detecting 
flaws parallel to the X-ray beam’s centerline. Internal 
anomalies, such as delaminations in the corners, crushed core, 
blown core, water in core cells, voids in foam adhesive joints, 
and relative position of internal details, can readily be seen 
via radiography. Most composites are nearly transparent to 
X-rays, so low energy rays must be used. Because of safety 
concerns, it is impractical to use around aircraft. Operators 
should always be protected by sufficient lead shields, as the 
possibility of exposure exists either from the X-ray tube or 
from scattered radiation. Maintaining a minimum safe distance 
from the X-ray source is always essential.
 
Thermography
Thermal inspection comprises all methods in which heat-
sensing devices are used to measure temperature variations 
for parts under inspection. The basic principle of thermal 
inspection consists of measuring or mapping of surface 
temperatures when heat flows from, to, or through a test 
object. All thermographic techniques rely on differentials 
in thermal conductivity between normal, defect free areas, 
and those having a defect. Normally, a heat source is used 
to elevate the temperature of the part being examined while 
observing the surface heating effects. Because defect free 
areas conduct heat more efficiently than areas with defects, 
the amount of heat that is either absorbed or reflected 
indicates the quality of the bond. The type of defects that 
affect the thermal properties include debonds, cracks, impact 
damage, panel thinning, and water ingress into composite 
materials and honeycomb core. Thermal methods are most 
effective for thin laminates or for defects near the surface.

Neutron Radiography
Neutron radiography is a nondestructive imaging technique 
that is capable of visualizing the internal characteristics of 
a sample. The transmission of neutrons through a medium 
is dependent upon the neutron cross sections for the nuclei 
in the medium. Differential attenuation of neutrons through 
a medium may be measured, mapped, and then visualized. 
The resulting image may then be utilized to analyze the 
internal characteristics of the sample. Neutron radiography 
is a complementary technique to X-ray radiography. Both 
techniques visualize the attenuation through a medium. 
The major advantage of neutron radiography is its ability to 
reveal light elements such as hydrogen found in corrosion 
products and water.

Moisture Detector 
A moisture meter can be used to detect water in sandwich 
honeycomb structures. A moisture meter measures the radio 
frequency (RF) power loss caused by the presence of water. 
The moisture meter is often used to detect moisture in nose 
radomes. [Figure 7-29] Figure 7-30 provides a comparison 
of NDI testing equipment.

Composite Repairs
Layup Materials
Hand Tools
Prepreg and dry fabrics can be cut with hand tools, such 
as scissors, pizza cutters, and knives. Materials made from 
Kevlar® are more difficult to cut than fiberglass or carbon 
and tools wear quicker. A squeegee and a brush are used 
to impregnate dry fibers with resin for wet layup. Markers, 
rulers, and circle templates are used to make a repair layout.
[Figure 7-31]

Air Tools
Air-driven power tools, such as drill motors, routers, and 
grinders, are used for composite materials. Electric motors 
are not recommended, because carbon is a conductive 
material that can cause an electrical short circuit. If electric 
tools are used, they need to be of the totally enclosed type.

Figure 7-30. Comparison of NDI testing equipment.

Figure 7-31. Hand tools for layup.
Figure 7-32. Air tools used for composite repair.

Caul Plate 
A caul plate made from aluminum is often used to support the 
part during the cure cycle. A mold release agent, or parting 
film, is applied to the caul plate so that the part does not attach 
to the caul plate. A thin caul plate is also used on top of the 
repair when a heat bonder is used. The caul plate provides a 
more uniform heated area and it leaves a smoother finish of 
the composite laminate.

Support Tooling and Molds
Certain repairs require tools to support the part and/or maintain 
surface contour during cure. A variety of materials can be used 
to manufacture these tools. The type of material depends on the 
type of repair, cure temperature, and whether it is a temporary 
or permanent tool. Support tooling is necessary for oven and 
autoclave cure due to the high cure temperature. The parts 

deform if support tooling is not used. There are many types 
of tooling material available. Some are molded to a specific 
part contour and others are used as rigid supports to maintain 
the contour during cure. Plaster is an inexpensive and easy 
material for contour tooling. It can be filled with fiberglass, 
hemp, or other material. Plaster is not very durable, but can be 
used for temporary tools. Often, a layer of fiberglass-reinforced 
epoxy is placed on the tool side surface to improve the finish 
quality. Tooling resins are used to impregnate fiberglass, 
carbon fiber, or other reinforcements to make permanent 
tools. Complex parts are made from metal or high-temperature 
tooling boards that are machined with 5-axis CNC equipment 
to make master tools that can be used to fabricate aircraft parts. 
[Figures 7-33 and 7-34]

Figure 7-34.  A mold of an inlet duct.

Vacuum Bag Materials 
Repairs of composite aircraft components are often performed 
with a technique known as vacuum bagging. A plastic bag is 
sealed around the repair area. Air is then removed from the 
bag, which allows repair plies to be drawn together with no 
air trapped in between. Atmospheric pressure bears on the 
repair and a strong, secure bond is created.

Several processing materials are used for vacuum bagging 
a part. These materials do not become part of the repair and 
are discarded after the repair process.

Release Agents
Release agents, also called mold release agents, are used so 
that the part comes off the tool or caul plate easily after curing. 

Bleeder Ply
The bleeder ply creates a path for the air and volatiles to 
escape from the repair. Excess resin is collected in the 
bleeder. Bleeder material could be made of a layer of 
fiberglass, nonwoven polyester, or it could be a perforated 
Teflon® coated material. The structural repair manual 
(SRM) indicates what type and how many plies of bleeder 
are required. As a general rule, the thicker the laminate, the 
more bleeder plies are required.

Peel Ply
Peel plies are often used to create a clean surface for bonding 
purposes. A thin layer of fiberglass is cured with the repair 
part. Just before the part is bonded to another structure, the 
peel ply is removed. The peel ply is easy to remove and leaves 
a clean surface for bonding. Peel plies are manufactured 
from polyester, nylon, flouronated ethylene propylene (FEP), 
or coated fiberglass. They can be difficult to remove if 
overheated. Some coated peel plies can leave an undesirable 
contamination on the surface. The preferred peel ply material 
is polyester that has been heat-set to eliminate shrinkage.

Layup Tapes
Vacuum bag sealing tape, also called sticky tape, is used to 
seal the vacuum bag to the part or tool. Always check the 
temperature rating of the tape before use to ensure that you 
use appropriately rated tape.

Perforated Release Film
Perforated parting film is used to allow air and volatiles out 
of the repair, and it prevents the bleeder ply from sticking to 
the part or repair. It is available with different size holes and 
hole spacing depending on the amount of bleeding required.

Solid Release Film
Solid release films are used so that the prepreg or wet layup 
plies do not stick to the working surface or caul plate. Solid 
release film is also used to prevent the resins from bleeding 
through and damaging the heat blanket or caul plate if they 
are used.

Breather Material
The breather material is used to provide a path for air to 
get out of the vacuum bag. The breather must contact the 
bleeder. Typically, polyester is used in either 4-ounce or 
10-ounce weights. Four ounces is used for applications below 
50 pounds per square inch (psi) and 10 ounces is used for 
50–100 psi.


7-22

Figure 7-35. Bagging materials.

Figure 7-36. Bagging of complex part.

Figure 7-37. Self-sealing vacuum bag with heater element.

Vacuum Bag 
The vacuum bag material provides a tough layer between 
the repair and the atmosphere. The vacuum bag material 
is available in different temperature ratings, so make sure 
that the material used for the repair can handle the cure 
temperature. Most vacuum bag materials are one time use, 
but material made from flexible silicon rubber is reusable. 
Two small cuts are made in the bagging material so that the 
vacuum probe valve can be installed. The vacuum bag is not 
very flexible and plies need to be made in the bag if complex 
shapes are to be bagged. Sometimes, an envelope type bag is 
used, but the disadvantage of this method is that the vacuum 
pressure might crush the part. Reusable bags made from 
silicon rubber are available that are more flexible. Some 
have a built-in heater blanket that simplifies the bagging 
task. [Figures 7-35, 7-36, and 7-37]

Vacuum Equipment
A vacuum pump is used to evacuate air and volatiles from 
the vacuum bag so that atmospheric pressure consolidates 
the plies. A dedicated vacuum pump is used in a repair shop. 
For repairs on the aircraft, a mobile vacuum pump could 
be used. Most heat bonders have a built-in vacuum pump. 
Special air hoses are used as vacuum lines, because regular air 
hoses might collapse when a vacuum is applied. The vacuum 
lines that are used in the oven or autoclave need to be able 
to withstand the high temperatures in the heating device. A 
vacuum pressure regulator is sometimes used to lower the 
vacuum pressure during the bagging process.

Vacuum Compaction Table
A vacuum compaction table is a convenient tool for debulking 
composite layups with multiple plies. Essentially a reusable 
vacuum bag, a compaction table consists of a metal table 
surface with a hinged cover. The cover includes a solid frame, 
a flexible membrane, and a vacuum seal. Repair plies are laid 
up on the table surface and sealed beneath the cover with 

vacuum to remove entrapped air. Some compaction tables 
are heated but most are not.

Heat Sources 
Oven
Composite materials can be cured in ovens using various 
pressure application methods. [Figure 7-38] Typically, 
vacuum bagging is used to remove volatiles and trapped air 
and utilizes atmospheric pressure for consolidation. Another 
method of pressure application for oven cures is the use of 
shrink wrapping or shrink tape. The oven uses heated air 
circulated at high speed to cure the material system. Typical 
oven cure temperatures are 250 °F and 350 °F. Ovens have 
a temperature sensor to feed temperature data back to the 


7-23

Figure 7-38. Walk-in curing oven.

Figure 7-39. Autoclave.

oven controller. The oven temperature can differ from the 
actual part temperature depending upon the location of the 
oven sensor and the location of the part in the oven. The 
thermal mass of the part in the oven is generally greater  
than the surrounding oven and during rise to temperature, 
the part temperature can lag the oven temperature by a 
considerable amount. To deal with these differences, at least 
two thermocouples must be placed on the part and connected 
to a temperature-sensing device (separate chart recorder, hot 
bonder, etc.) located outside the oven. Some oven controllers 
can be controlled by thermocouples placed on the repair part. 

Autoclave
An autoclave system allows a complex chemical reaction to 
occur inside a pressure vessel according to a specified time, 

temperature, and pressure profile in order to process a variety 
of materials. [Figure 7-39] The evolution of materials and 
processes has taken autoclave operating conditions from 
120 °C (250 °F) and 275 kPa (40 psi) to well over 760 °C 
(1,400 °F) and 69,000 kPa (10,000 psi). Autoclaves that 
are operated at lower temperatures and pressures can be 
pressurized by air, but if higher temperatures and pressures 
are required for the cure cycle, a 50/50 mixture of air and 
nitrogen or 100 percent nitrogen should be used to reduce 
the change of an autoclave fire. 

The major elements of an autoclave system are a vessel to 
contain pressure, sources to heat the gas stream and circulate 
it uniformly within the vessel, a subsystem to apply vacuum 
to parts covered by a vacuum bag, a subsystem to control 
operating parameters, and a subsystem to load the molds into 
the autoclave. Modern autoclaves are computer controlled 
and the operator can write and monitor all types of cure cycle 
programs. The most accurate way to control the cure cycle is 
to control the autoclave controller with thermocouples that 
are placed on the actual part. 

Most parts processed in autoclaves are covered with a vacuum 
bag that is used primarily for compaction of laminates and to 
provide a path for removal of volatiles. The bag allows the 
part to be subjected to differential pressure in the autoclave 
without being directly exposed to the autoclave atmosphere. 
The vacuum bag is also used to apply varying levels of 
vacuum to the part. 

Heat Bonder and Heat Lamps
Typical on-aircraft heating methods include electrical 
resistance heat blankets, infrared heat lamps, and hot air 
devices. All heating devices must be controlled by some 
means so that the correct amount of heat can be applied. This 
is particularly important for repairs using prepreg material 
and adhesives, because controlled heating and cooling rates 
are usually prescribed.


7-24

Figure 7-40. Heat bonder equipment.

Figure 7-41. Heat blankets. Figure 7-42. Heat press.

Heat Bonder

A heat bonder is a portable device that automatically controls 
heating based on temperature feedback from the repair area. 
Heat bonders also have a vacuum pump that supplies and 
monitors the vacuum in the vacuum bag. The heat bonder 
controls the cure cycle with thermocouples that are placed 
near the repair. Some repairs require up to 10 thermocouples. 
Modern heat bonders can run many different types of cure 
programs and cure cycle data can be printed out or uploaded 
to a computer. [Figure 7-40]

Heat Blanket

A heat blanket is a flexible heater. It is made of two layers 
of silicon rubber with a metal resistance heater between the 
two layers of silicon. Heat blankets are a common method 
of applying heat for repairs on the aircraft. Heat blankets 
may be controlled manually; however, they are usually used 
in conjunction with a heat bonder. Heat is transferred from 
the blanket via conduction. Consequently, the heat blanket 
must conform to and be in 100 percent contact with the part, 
which is usually accomplished using vacuum bag pressure. 
[Figure 7-41]

Heat Lamp

Infrared heat lamps can also be used for elevated temperature 
curing of composites if a vacuum bag is not utilized. 
However, they are generally not effective for producing 
curing temperatures above 150 °F, or for areas larger than two 
square feet. It is also difficult to control the heat applied with 
a lamp, and lamps tend to generate high-surface temperatures 
quickly. If controlled by thermostats, heat lamps can be useful 
in applying curing heat to large or irregular surfaces. Heat 
bonders can be used to control heat lamps.

Hot Air System

Hot air systems can be used to cure composite repairs, and 
are mainly restricted to small repairs and for drying the repair 
area. A heat generator supplies hot air that is directed into an 
insulated enclosure set up around the repair area after vacuum 
bagging has been deployed. The hot air surrounds the repair 
for even temperature rise.

Heat Press Forming
During the press forming process, flat stacked thermoplastic 
prepreg is heated to above melt temperature (340–430 °C, 
or 645–805 °F) in an oven, rapidly (1–10 seconds) shuttled 
to a forming die, pressed to shape, and consolidated and 
cooled under pressure (700–7,000 kPa, or 100–1,000 psi). 
[Figure 7-42] In production, press forming dies usually are 
matched male-female sets constructed of steel or aluminum. 
However, rubber, wood, phenolics, and so on can be used 
during prototyping. The die set can be maintained at room 
temperature throughout the forming-consolidation cycle. 
But, the use of a hot die (120–200 °C, or 250–390 °F) allows 
control of the cooling-down rate (avoiding part warpage and 
controlling morphology in semicrystalline thermoplastic 
prepreg, such as PEEK and polyphenylene sulfide) and 
extends the forming window promoting better ply slip. 


7-25

The main disadvantage with this method is that the press only 
applies pressure in one direction, and hence, it is difficult to 
make complex-shaped (e.g., beads, closed corners) parts or 
parts with legs that approach vertical. Since the temperature 
of the die set need not be cycled with each part, rapid forming 
times of between 10 minutes and 2 hours are achievable with 
press forming. 

Thermocouples
A thermocouple (TC) is a thermoelectric device used to 
accurately measure temperatures. It may be connected to 
a simple temperature reading device, or connected to a hot 
bonder, oven, or other type of controller that regulates the 
amount of heat. TCs consist of a wire with two leads of 
dissimilar metals that are joined at one end. Heating the 
joint produces an electric current, which is converted to a 
temperature reading with a TC monitor. Select the type of 
wire (J or K) and the type of connector that are compatible 
with the local temperature monitoring equipment (hot bonder, 
oven, autoclave, etc.). TC wire is available with different 
types of insulation; check the manufacturer’s product data 
sheets to ensure the insulation withstands the highest cure 
temperature. Teflon-insulated wire is generally good for 
390 °F and lower cures; Kapton-insulated wire should be 
used for higher temperatures.

Thermocouple Placement

Thermocouple placement is the key in obtaining proper 
cure temperatures throughout the repair. In general, the 
thermocouples used for temperature control should be placed 
as close as possible to the repair material without causing it 
to become embedded in the repair or producing indentations 
in the repair. They should also be placed in strategic hot or 
cold locations to ensure the materials are adequately cured 
but not exposed to excessively high temperatures that could 
degrade the material structural properties. The thermocouples 
should be placed as close as practical to the area that needs 
to be monitored. The following steps should be taken when 
using thermocouples:

•  Never use fewer than three thermocouples to monitor 
a heating cycle. 

• If bonding a precured patch, place the thermocouple 
near the center of the patch.

• A control thermocouple may be centered over a 
low-temperature (200 °F or lower) co-cured patch as 
long as it is placed on top of a thin metallic sheet to 
prevent a thermocouple indentation onto the patch. 
This may allow for a more accurate control of the 
patch temperature.

• The thermocouples installed around the perimeter 
of the repair patch should be placed approximately 
0.5-inch away from the edge of the adhesive line. 

• Place flash tape below and above the thermocouple 
tips to protect them from resin flash and to protect the 
control unit from electrical shorts. 

• Do not place the thermocouple under the vacuum 
port as the pressure may damage the lead and cause 
erroneous readings to occur.

• Do not place thermocouple wires adjacent to or 
crossing the heat blanket power cord to prevent 
erroneous temperature readings caused by magnetic 
flux lines.

• Do not place any control thermocouple beyond the 
heat blanket’s two-inch overlap of the repair to prevent 
the controller from trying to compensate for the lower 
temperature. 

• Always leave slack in the thermocouple wire under the 
vacuum bag to prevent the thermocouple from being 
pulled away from the area to be monitored as vacuum 
is applied.

Thermal Survey of Repair Area

In order to achieve maximum structural bonded composite 
repair, it is essential to cure these materials within the 
recommended temperature range. Failure to cure at the correct 
temperatures can produce weak patches and/or bonding 
surfaces and can result in a repair failure during service. A 
thermal survey should be performed prior to installing the 
repair to ensure proper and uniform temperatures can be 
achieved. The thermal survey determines the heating and 
insulation requirements, as well as TC locations for the repair 
area. The thermal survey is especially useful for determining 
the methods of heating (hot air modules, heat lamps, heat 
blanket method and monitoring requirements in cases where 
heat sinks (substructure for instance) exist in the repair area). 
It should be performed for all types of heating methods to 
preclude insufficient, excessive, or uneven heating of the 
repair area. 

Temperature Variations in Repair Zone

Thermal variations in the repair area occur for many reasons. 
Primary among these are material type, material thickness, 
and underlying structure in the repair zone. For these reasons, 
it is important to know the structural composition of the 
area to be repaired. Substructure existing in the repair zone 
conducts heat away from the repair area, resulting in a cold 
spot directly above the structure. Thin skins heat quickly 
and can easily be overheated. Thick skin sections absorb 
heat slowly and take longer to reach soak temperature. The 
thermal survey identifies these problem areas and allows the 
technician to develop the heat and insulation setup required 
for even heating of the repair area.

Thermal Survey

During the thermal survey process, try to determine possible 
hot and cold areas in the repair zone. Temporarily attach a 
patch of the same material and thickness, several thermal 
couples, heating blanket, and a vacuum bag to the repair 
area. Heat the area and, after the temperature is stabilized, 
record the thermocouple temperatures. Add insulation if the 
temperature of the thermocouple varies more than 10 degrees 
from average. The areas with a stringer and rib indicate a 
lower temperature than the middle of the patch because they 
act as a heat sink. Add insulation to these areas to increase 
the temperature. [Figure 7-43] 

Solutions to Heat Sink Problems

Additional insulation can be placed over the repair area. 
This insulation can also be extended beyond the repair area 
to minimize heat being conducted away. Breather materials 
and fiberglass cloths work well, either on top of the vacuum 
bag or within the vacuum bag or on the accessible backside 
of the structure. Place more insulation over cool spots and 
less insulation over hot spots. If access is available to the 
backside of the repair area, additional heat blankets could be 
placed there to heat the repair area more evenly.

Types of Layups
Wet Layups 
During the wet layup process, a dry fabric is impregnated with 
a resin. Mix the resin system just before making the repair. 
Lay out the repair plies on a piece of fabric and impregnate 
the fabric with the resin. After the fabric is impregnated, 
cut the repair plies, stack in the correct ply orientation, and 
vacuum bag. Wet layup repairs are often used with fiberglass 
for nonstructural applications. Carbon and Kevlar® dry fabric 
could also be used with a wet layup resin system. Many resin 
systems used with wet layup cure at room temperature, are 
easy to accomplish, and the materials can be stored at room 
temperature for long period of times. The disadvantage of 
room temperature wet layup is that it does not restore the 
strength and durability of the original structure and parts 
that were cured at 250 °F or 350 °F during manufacturing. 
Some wet layup resins use an elevated temperature cure and 
have improved properties. In general, wet layup properties 
are less than properties of prepreg material.
   
Epoxy resins may require refrigeration until they are used. 
This prevents the aging of the epoxy. The label on the 
container states the correct storage temperature for each 
component. The typical storage temperature is between 40 °F 
and 80 °F for most epoxy resins. Some resin systems require 
storage below 40 °F.

Prepreg
Prepreg is a fabric or tape that is impregnated with a resin 
during the manufacturing process. The resin system is 
already mixed and is in the B stage cure. Store the prepreg 
material in a freezer below 0 °F to prevent further curing 
of the resin. The material is typically placed on a roll and a 
backing material is placed on one side of the material so that 
the prepreg does not stick together. The prepreg material is 
sticky and adheres to other plies easily during the stack-up 
process. You must remove the prepreg from the freezer and 
let the material thaw, which might take 8 hours for a full 
roll. Store the prepreg materials in a sealed, moisture proof 
bag. Do not open these bags until the material is completely 
thawed, to prevent contamination of the material by moisture. 

After the material is thawed and removed from the backing 
material, cut it in repair plies, stack in the correct ply 
orientation, and vacuum bag. Do not forget to remove the 
backing material when stacking the plies. Cure prepregs at 
an elevated cure cycle; the most common temperatures used 
are 250 °F and 350 °F. Autoclaves, curing ovens, and heat 
bonders can be used to cure the prepreg material.

Consolidation is necessary if parts are made from several 
layers of prepreg, because large quantities of air can be 
trapped between each prepreg layer. Remove this trapped air 
by covering the prepreg with a perforated release film and a 
breather ply, and apply a vacuum bag. Apply the vacuum for 
10 to 15 minutes at room temperature. Typically, attach the 
first consolidated ply to the tool face and repeat this process 
after every 3 or 5 layers depending on the prepreg thickness 
and component shape.

Store prepreg, film adhesive, and foaming adhesives in 
a freezer at a temperature below 0 °F. If these types of 
materials need to be shipped, place them in special containers 
filled with dry ice. The freezer must not be of the automatic 
defrost type; the auto-defrost cycle periodically warms the 
inside of the freezer, which can reduce the shelf life and 
consume the allowable out-time of the composite material. 
Freezers must be capable of maintaining 0 °F or below; 
most household freezers meet this level. Walk-in freezers 
can be used for large volume cold storage. If usage is small, 
a chest-type freezer may suffice. Refrigerators are used to 
store laminating and paste adhesives and should be kept near 
40 °F. [Figure 7-44]

Uncured prepreg materials have time limits for storage and 
use. [Figure 7-45] The maximum time allowed for storing 
of a prepreg at low temperature is called the storage life, 
which is typically 6 months to a year. The material can be 
tested, and the storage life could be extended by the material 
manufacturer. The maximum time allowed for material at 

room temperature before the material cures is called the 
mechanical life. The recommended time at room temperature 
to complete layup and compaction is called the handling 
life. The handling life is shorter than the mechanical life. 
The mechanical life is measured from the time the material 
is removed from the freezer until the time the material is 
returned to the freezer. The operator must keep records of 
the time in and out of the freezer. Material that exceeds the 
mechanical life needs to be discarded.

Many repair facilities cut the material in smaller kits and 
store them in moisture-proof bags that thaw quicker when 
removed from the freezer. This also limits the time out of 
the freezer for a big roll.

All frozen prepreg materials need to be stored in moisture-
proof bag to avoid moisture contamination. All prepreg 
material should be protected from dust, oil, vapors, smoke, 
and other contaminants. A clean room for repair layup would 
be best, but if a clean room is not available, the prepreg should 
be protected by storing them in bags or keeping them covered 
with plastic. Before starting the layup, cover the unprotected 
sides of the prepreg with parting film, and clean the area 
being repaired immediately before laying up the repair plies.

Prepreg material is temperature sensitive. Excessively 
high temperatures cause the material to begin curing, and 
excessively low temperatures make the material difficult 
to handle. For repairs on aircraft in very cold or very hot 
climates, the area should be protected by a tent around the 
repair area. Prepare the prepreg repair plies in a controlled-
temperature environment and bring them to the repair area 
immediately before using them. 

Co-curing
Co-curing is a process wherein two parts are simultaneously 
cured. The interface between the two parts may or may not 
have an adhesive layer. Co-curing often results in poor panel 
surface quality, which is prevented by using a secondary 
surfacing material co-cured in the standard cure cycle or 
a subsequent fill-and-fair operation. Co-cured skins may 
also have poorer mechanical properties, requiring the use of 
reduced design values.

A typical co-cure application is the simultaneous cure of a 
stiffener and a skin. Adhesive film is frequently placed into 
the interface between the stiffener and the skin to increase 
fatigue and peel resistance. Principal advantages derived 
from the co-cure process are excellent fit between bonded 
components and guaranteed surface cleanliness.

Secondary Bonding
Secondary bonding utilizes precured composite detail parts, 
and uses a layer of adhesive to bond two precured composite 
parts. Honeycomb sandwich assemblies commonly use 
a secondary bonding process to ensure optimal structural 
performance. Laminates co-cured over honeycomb core may 
have distorted plies that have dipped into the core cells. As 
a result, compressive stiffness and strength can be reduced 
as much as 10 and 20 percent, respectively.

Precured laminates undergoing secondary bonding usually 
have a thin nylon or fiberglass peel ply cured onto the 
bonding surfaces. While the peel ply sometimes hampers 
nondestructive inspection of the precured laminate, it has 
been found to be the most effective means of ensuring 
surface cleanliness prior to bonding. When the peel ply is 
stripped away, a pristine surface becomes available. Light 
scuff sanding removes high resin peak impressions produced 
by the peel ply weave which, if they fracture, create cracks 
in the bondline.

Composite materials can be used to structurally repair, restore, 
or enhance aluminum, steel, and titanium components. 
Bonded composite doublers have the ability to slow or stop 
fatigue crack growth, replace lost structural area due to 
corrosion grind-outs, and structurally enhance areas with 
small and negative margins. This technology has often 

been referred to as a combination of metal bonding and 
conventional on-aircraft composite bonded repair. Boron 
prepreg tape with an epoxy resin is most often used for this 
application.

Co-bonding
In the co-bonding process, one of the detail parts is precured 
with the mating part being cured simultaneously with the 
adhesive. Film adhesive is often used to improve peel 
strength.

Layup Process (Typical Laminated Wet Layup)
Layup Techniques
Read the SRM and determine the correct repair material, 
number of plies required for the repair, and the ply 
orientation. Dry the part, remove the damage, and taper 
sand the edges of damaged area. Use a piece of thin plastic, 
and trace the size of each repair ply from the damaged area. 
Indicate the ply orientation of each ply on the trace sheet. 
Copy the repair ply information to a piece of repair material 
that is large enough to cut all plies. Impregnate the repair 
material with resin, place a piece of transparent release film 
over the fabric, cut out the plies, and lay up the plies in the 
damaged area. The plies are usually placed using the smallest 
ply first taper layup sequence, but an alternative method is to 
use the largest ply first layup sequence. In this sequence, the 
first layer of reinforcing fabric completely covers the work 
area, followed by successively smaller layers, and then is 
finished with an extra outer layer or two extending over the 
patch and onto the sound laminate for some distance. Both 
methods are illustrated in Figures 7-46 and 7-47.

Bleedout Technique
The traditional bleedout using a vacuum bag technique places 
a perforated release film and a breather/bleeder ply on top of 
the repair. The holes in the release film allow air to breath 
and resin to bleed off over the entire repair area. The amount 
of resin bled off depends on the size and number of holes 
in the perforated release film, the thickness of the bleeder/
breather cloth, the resin viscosity and temperature, and the 
vacuum pressure. 

Controlled bleed allows a limited amount of resin to bleed 
out in a bleeder ply. Place a piece of perforated release film 
on top of the prepreg material, a bleeder ply on top of the 
perforated release film, and a solid release film on top of the 
bleeder. Use a breather and a vacuum bag to compact the 
repair. The breather allows the air to escape. The bleeder can 
only absorb a limited amount of resin, and the amount of resin 
that is bled can be controlled by using multiple bleeder plies. 
Too many bleeder plies can result in a resin-starved repair. 
Always consult the maintenance manual or manufacturer tech 
sheets for correct bagging and bleeding techniques.

No Bleedout
Prepreg systems with 32 to 35 percent resin content are 
typically no-bleed systems. These prepregs contain exactly 
the amount of resin needed in the cured laminate; therefore, 
resin bleedoff is not desired. Bleedout of these prepregs results 
in a resin-starved repair or part. Many high-strength prepregs 
in use today are no-bleed systems. No bleeder is used, and the 
resin is trapped/sealed so that none bleeds away. Consult the 
maintenance manual to determine if bleeder plies are required 
for the repair. A sheet of solid release film (no holes) is placed 
on top of the prepreg and taped off at the edges with flash 
tape. Small openings are created at the edges of the tape so 
that air can escape. A breather and vacuum bag are installed 
to compact the prepreg plies. The air can escape on the edge 
of the repair but no resin can bleed out. [Figure 7-48]

Horizontal (or edge) bleedout is used for small room 
temperature wet layup repairs. A 2-inch strip of breather cloth 
is placed around the repair or part (edge breather). There is no 
need for a release film because there is no bleeder/breather 
cloth on top of the repair. The part is impregnated with resin, 
and the vacuum bag is placed over the repair. A vacuum is 
applied and a squeegee is used to remove air and excess resin 
to the edge breather. 

Ply Orientation Warp Clock
In order to minimize any residual thermal stresses caused 
during cure of the resin, it is always good practice to design 
a symmetrical, or balanced, laminate. Examples of balance 
laminates are presented in Figure 7-49. The first example 
uses unidirectional tape, and examples 2 and 3 are typical 
quasi-isotropic laminates fabricated from woven cloth.

Figure 7-50 presents examples of the effects caused 
by nonsymmetrical laminates. These effects are most 
pronounced in laminates that are cured at high temperature 
in an autoclave or oven due to the thermal stresses developed 
in the laminate as the laminate cools down from the cure 
temperature to room temperature. Laminates cured at room 
temperature using typical wet layup do not exhibit the same 
degree of distortion due to the much smaller thermal stresses.

The strength and stiffness of a composite buildup depends 
on the ply orientation. The practical range of strength and 
stiffness of carbon epoxy extends from values as low as 
those provided by fiberglass to as high as those provided by 
titanium. This range of values is determined by the orientation 
of the plies to the applied load. Because the strength design 
requirement is a function of the applied load direction, ply 
orientation and ply sequence must be correct. It is critical 
during a repair operation to replace each damaged ply with 
a ply of the same material and orientation or an approved 
substitute.

Warp is the longitudinal fibers of a fabric. The warp is the 
high-strength direction due to the straightness of the fibers. 
A warp clock is used to describe direction of fibers on a 
diagram, spec sheet, or manufacturer’s sheets. If the warp 
clock is not available on the fabric, the orientation is defaulted 
to zero as the fabric comes off the roll. Therefore, 90° to zero 
is across the width of the fabric. 90° to zero is also called 
the fill direction. 

Mixing Resins 
Epoxy resins, like all multipart materials, must be thoroughly 
mixed. Some resin systems have a dye added to aid in seeing 
how well the material is mixed. Since many resin systems do 
not have a dye, the resin must be mixed slowly and fully for 
three minutes. Air enters into the mixture if the resin is mixed 
too fast. If the resin system is not fully mixed, the resin may 
not cure properly. Make sure to scrape the edges and bottom 
of the mixing cup to ensure that all resin is mixed correctly.

Do not mix large quantities of quick curing resin. These types 
of resins produce heat after they are mixed. Smoke can burn 
or poison you when the resin overheats. Mix only the amount 
of material that is required. Mix more than one batch if more 
material is needed than the maximum batch size. 

Saturation Techniques
For wet layup repair, impregnate the fabric with resin. It is 
important to put the right amount of resin on the fabric. Too 
much or too little resin affects the strength of the repair. Air 
that is put into the resin or not removed from the fabric also 
reduces the repair strength. 

Fabric Impregnation With a Brush or Squeegee
The traditional way of impregnating the fabric is by using 
a brush or squeegee. The technician puts a mold release 
compound or a release film on a caul plate so that the plies 
will not adhere to the caul plate. Place a sheet of fabric on 
the caul plate and apply resin in the middle of the sheet. Use 
a brush or squeegee to thoroughly wet the fabric. More plies 
of fabric and resin are added and the process is repeated 
until all plies are impregnated. A vacuum bag will be used 
to consolidate the plies and to bleed off excess resin and 
volatiles. Most wet layup processes have a room temperature 
cure but extra heat, up to 150 °F, are used to speed up the 
curing process. [Figure 7-51]

Fabric Impregnation Using a Vacuum Bag
The vacuum-assisted impregnation method is used to 
impregnate repair fabric with a two-part resin while enclosed 
inside a vacuum bag. This method is preferred for tight-
knit weaves and when near optimum resin-to-fiber ratio is 
required. Compared to squeegee impregnation, this process 
reduces the level of entrapped air within the fabric and offers 
a more controlled and contained configuration for completing 
the impregnation process.

Vacuum-assisted impregnation consists of the following 
steps:

1. Place vacuum bag sealing tape on the table surface 
around the area that is used to impregnate the material. 
The area should be at least 4 inches larger than the 
material to be impregnated.

2. Place an edge breather cloth next to the vacuum bag 
sealing tape. The edge breather should be 1–2 inches 
wide.

3. Place a piece of solid parting film on the table. The 
sheet should be 2-inches larger than the material to 
be impregnated.

4. Weigh the fabric to find the amount of resin mix that 
is necessary to impregnate the material.

5. Lay the fabric on the parting film.

6. Put a piece of breather material between the fabric 
and the edge breather to provide an air path.


7-31

Figure 7-51. Fabric impregnation with a brush or squeegee: A) wet layup materials; B) fabric placement; C) fabric impregnation; D) 
squeegee used to thoroughly wet the fabric.

7. Pour the resin onto the fabric. The resin should be a 
continuous pool in the center area of the fabric.

8. Put vacuum probes on the edge breather.

9. Place a second piece of solid parting film over the 
fabric. This film should be the same size or larger 
than the first piece.

10. Place and seal the vacuum bag, and apply vacuum to 
the bag.

11. Allow 2 minutes for the air to be removed from the 
fabric.

12. Sweep the resin into the fabric with a squeegee. 
Slowly sweep the resin from the center to the edge of 
the fabric. The resin should be uniformly distributed 
over all of the fabric. 

13. Remove the fabric and cut the repair plies.

Vacuum Bagging Techniques
Vacuum bag molding is a process in which the layup is cured 
under pressure generated by drawing a vacuum in the space 

between the layup and a flexible sheet placed over it and 
sealed at the edges. In the vacuum bag molding process, the 
plies are generally placed in the mold by hand layup using 
prepreg or wet layup. High-flow resins are preferred for 
vacuum bag molding.

Single Side Vacuum Bagging
This is the preferred method if the repair part is large enough 
for a vacuum bag on one side of the repair. The vacuum bag 
is taped in place with tacky tape and a vacuum port is placed 
through the bag to create the vacuum.

Envelope Bagging
Envelope bagging is a process in which the part to be repaired 
is completely enclosed in a vacuum bag or the bag is wrapped 
around the end of the component to obtain an adequate seal. It 
is frequently used for removable aircraft parts, such as flight 
controls, access panels, etc., and when a part’s geometry 
and/or the repair location makes it very difficult to properly 
vacuum bag and seal the area in a vacuum. In some cases, a 
part may be too small to allow installation of a single-side

bag vacuum. Other times, the repair is located on the end of 
a large component that must have a vacuum bag wrapped 
around the ends and sealed all the way around. [Figure 7-52]

Alternate Pressure Application
Shrink Tape
Another method of pressure application for oven cures is 
the use of shrink wrapping or shrink tape. This method is 
commonly used with parts that have been filament wound, 
because some of the same rules for application apply. The 
tape is wrapped around the completed layup, usually with 
only a layer of release material between the tape and the 
layup. Heat is applied to the tape, usually using a heat gun to 
make the tape shrink, a process that can apply a tremendous 
amount of pressure to the layup. After shrinking, the part is 
placed in the oven for cure. High quality parts can be made 
inexpensively using shrink tape.

C-Clamps
Parts can also be pressed together with clamps. This 
technique is used for solid laminate edges of honeycomb 
panels. Clamps (e.g., C-clamps and spring clamps) are used 
for pressing together the edges of components and/or repair 
details. Always use clamps with pressure distribution pads 
because damage to the part may occur if the clamping force 
is too high. Spring clamps can be used in applications where 
resin squeeze-out during cure would require C-clamps to be 
retightened periodically.

Shotbags and Weights
Shotbags and weights can be used also to provide pressure, 
but their use is limited due to the low level of pressure 
imposed.

Curing of Composite Materials
A cure cycle is the time/temperature/pressure cycle used to 
cure a thermosetting resin system or prepreg. The curing 
of a repair is as important as the curing of the original part 
material. Unlike metal repairs in which the materials are 
premanufactured, composite repairs require the technician 
to manufacture the material. This includes all storage, 
processing, and quality control functions. An aircraft repair’s 
cure cycle starts with material storage. Materials that are 
stored incorrectly can begin to cure before they are used 
for a repair. All time and temperature requirements must be 
met and documented. Consult the aircraft structural repair 
manual to determine the correct cure cycle for the part that 
needs to be repaired.

Room Temperature Curing
Room temperature curing is the most advantageous in terms 
of energy savings and portability. Room temperature cure 
wet layup repairs do not restore either the strength or the 
durability of the original 250 °F or 350 °F cure components 
and are often used for wet layup fiberglass repairs for 
noncritical components. Room temperature cure repairs 
can be accelerated by the application of heat. Maximum 
properties are achieved at 150 °F. A vacuum bag can be 
used to consolidate the plies and to provide a path for air 
and volatiles to escape.

Elevated Temperature Curing
All prepreg materials are cured with an elevated temperature 
cure cycle. Some wet layup repairs use an elevated cure 
cycle as well to increase repair strength and to speed up 
the curing process. The curing oven and heat bonder uses a 
vacuum bag to consolidate the plies and to provide a path 
for air and volatiles to escape. The autoclave uses vacuum 
and positive pressure to consolidate the plies and to provide 
a path for air and volatiles to escape. Most heating devices 
use a programmable computer control to run the cure cycles. 
The operator can select from a menu of available cure cycles 
or write his or her own program. Thermocouples are placed 
near the repair, and they provide temperature feedback for 
the heating device. Typical curing temperature for composite 
materials is 250 °F or 350 °F. The temperature of large parts 
that are cured in an oven or autoclave might be different 
from that of an oven or autoclave during the cure cycle, 
because they act like a heat sink. The part temperature is 
most important for a correct cure, so thermocouples are 
placed on the part to monitor and control part temperature. 
The oven or autoclave air temperature probe that measures 
oven or autoclave temperature is not always a reliable device 
to determine part curing temperature. The oven temperature 
and the part temperature can be substantially different if the 
part or tool acts as a heat sink.

Figure 7-53. Autoclave cure.

The elevated cure cycle consists of at least three segments: 

• Ramp up: The heating device ramps up at a set 
temperature typically between 3 °F to 5 °F per minute. 

• Hold or soak: The heating device maintains the 
temperature for a predetermined period. 

• Cool down: The heating device cools down at a set 
temperature. Cool down temperatures are typically 
below 5 °F per minute. When the heating device is 
below 125 °F, the part can be removed. When an 
autoclave is used for curing parts, make sure that the 
pressure in the autoclave is relieved before the door 
is opened. [Figure 7-53]

The curing process is accomplished by the application of heat 
and pressure to the laminate. The resin begins to soften and 
flow as the temperature is increased. At lower temperatures, 

very little reaction occurs. Any volatile contaminants, such 
as air and/or water, are drawn out of the laminate with 
vacuum during this time. The laminate is compacted by 
applying pressure, usually vacuum (atmospheric pressure); 
autoclaves apply additional pressure, typically 50–100 psi. 
As the temperature approaches the final cure temperature, 
the rate of reaction greatly increases, and the resin begins to 
gel and harden. The hold at the final cure lets the resin finish 
curing and attain the desired structural properties. 

Composite Honeycomb Sandwich Repairs
A large proportion of current aerospace composite 
components are light sandwich structures that are susceptible 
to damage and are easily damaged. Because sandwich 
structure is a bonded construction and the face sheets are 
thin, damage to sandwich structure is usually repaired by 
bonding. Repairs to sandwich honeycomb structure use

similar techniques for the most common types of face sheet 
materials, such as fiberglass, carbon, and Kevlar®. Kevlar® 

is often repaired with fiberglass. [Figure 7-54]

Damage Classification
A temporary repair meets the strength requirements, but is 
limited by time or flight cycles. At the end of the repair’s life, 
the repair must be removed and replaced. An interim repair 
restores the required strength to the component. However, 
this repair does not restore the required durability to the 
component. Therefore, it has a different inspection interval 
and/or method. A permanent repair is a repair that restores 
the required strength and durability to the component. The 
repair has the same inspection method and interval as the 
original component. 

Sandwich Structures
Minor Core Damage (Filler and Potting Repairs)
A potted repair can be used to repair damage to a sandwich 
honeycomb structure that is smaller than 0.5 inches. The 
honeycomb material could be left in place or could be 
removed and is filled up with a potting compound to restore 
some strength. Potted repairs do not restore the full strength 
of the part.

Potting compounds are most often epoxy resins filled with 
hollow glass, phenolic or plastic microballoons, cotton, flox, 
or other materials. The potting compound can also be used as 
filler for cosmetic repairs to edges and skin panels. Potting 
compounds are also used in sandwich honeycomb panels 
as hard points for bolts and screws. The potting compound 
is heavier than the original core and this could affect flight 
control balance. The weight of the repair must be calculated 
and compared with flight control weight and balance limits 
set out in the SRM.

Damage Requiring Core Replacement and Repair 
to One or Both Faceplates
Note: the following steps are not a substitution for the aircraft 
specific Structural Repair Manual (SRM). Do not assume that 
the repair methods used by one manufacturer are applicable 
to another manufacturer.

Step 1: Inspect the Damage

Thin laminates can be visually inspected and tap tested to 
map out the damage. [Figure 7-55] Thicker laminates need 
more in-depth NDI methods, such as ultrasonic inspection. 
Check in the vicinity of the damage for entry of water, oil, 
fuel, dirt, or other foreign matter. Water can be detected with 
X-ray, back light, or a moisture detector. 

Step 2: Remove Water From Damaged Area

Water needs to be removed from the core before the part is 
repaired. [Figure 7-56] If the water is not removed, it boils

during the elevated temperature cure cycle and the face sheets 
blow off the core, resulting in more damage. Water in the 
honeycomb core could also freeze at the low temperatures 
that exist at high altitudes, which could result in disbonding 
of the face sheets. 

Step 3: Remove the Damage

Trim out the damage to the face sheet to a smooth shape with 
rounded corners, or a circular or oval shape. Do not damage 
the undamaged plies, core, or surrounding material. If the 
core is damaged as well, remove the core by trimming to the 
same outline as the skin. [Figure 7-57]

Step 4: Prepare the Damaged Area

Use a flexible disk sander or a rotating pad sander to taper 
sand a uniform taper around the cleaned up damage. Some 
manufacturers give a taper ratio, such as 1:40, and others 
prescribe a taper distance like a 1-inch overlap for each 
existing ply of the face sheet. Remove the exterior finish, 
including conductive coating for an area that is at least 1 inch 
larger than the border of the taper. Remove all sanding dust 
with dry compressed air and a vacuum cleaner. Use a clean 
cloth moistened with approved solvent to clean the damaged 
area. [Figure 7-58]

Step 5: Installation of Honeycomb Core (Wet Layup)

Use a knife to cut the replacement core. The core plug must 
be of the same type, class, and grade of the original core. The 
direction of the core cells should line up with the honey comb

of the surrounding material. The plug must be trimmed to the 
right length and be solvent washed with an approved cleaner.

For a wet layup repair, cut two plies of woven fabric that fit 
on the inside surface of the undamaged skin. Impregnate the 
fabric plies with a resin and place in the hole. Use potting 
compound around the core and place it in the hole. For a 
prepreg repair, cut a piece of film adhesive that fits the hole 
and use a foaming adhesive around the plug. The plug should 
touch the sides of the hole. Line up the cells of the plug with 
the original material. Vacuum bag the repair area and use an 
oven, autoclave, or heat blanket to cure the core replacement. 
The wet layup repair can be cured at a room temperature up to 
150 °F. The prepreg repair must be cured at 250 °F or 350 °F. 
Usually, the core replacement is cured with a separate curing 
cycle and not co-cured with the patch. The plug must be sanded 
flush with the surrounding area after the cure. [Figure 7-59]

Step 6: Prepare and Install the Repair Plies

Consult the repair manual for the correct repair material and 
the number of plies required for the repair. Typically, one 
more ply than the original number of plies is installed. Cut 
the plies to the correct size and ply orientation. The repair 
plies must be installed with the same orientation as that of 
the original plies being repaired. Impregnate the plies with 
resin for the wet layup repair, or remove the backing material 
from the prepreg material. The plies are usually placed using 
the smallest ply first taper layup sequence. [Figure 7-60]

Step 7: Vacuum Bag the Repair

Once the ply materials are in place, vacuum bagging is used 
to remove air and to pressurize the repair for curing. Refer 
to Figure 7-61 for bagging instructions.

Step 8: Curing the Repair

The repair is cured at the required cure cycle. Wet layup 
repairs can be cured at room temperature. An elevated 

temperature up to 150 °F can be used to speed up the cure. 
The prepreg repair needs to be cured at an elevated cure cycle. 
[Figure 7-62] Parts that can be removed from the aircraft 
could be cured in a hot room, oven, or autoclave. A heating 
blanket is used for on-aircraft repairs.

Remove the bagging materials after curing and inspect the 
repair. The repair should be free from pits, blisters, resin-
rich and resin-starved areas. Lightly sand the repair patch to 
produce a smooth finish without damaging the fibers. Apply 
top finish and conductive coating (lighting protection).

Step 9: Post Repair Inspection

Use visual, tap, and/or ultrasonic inspection to inspect 
the repair. Remove the repair patch if defects are found. 
[Figure 7-63]

Perform a balance check if a repair to a flight control surface 
was made, and ensure that the repaired flight control is within 
limits of the SRM. Failure to do so could result in flight 
control flutter, and safety of flight could be affected.

Solid Laminates
Bonded Flush Patch Repairs
New generation aircraft have fuselage and wing structures 
made from solid laminates that are externally stiffened with 
co-cured or co-bonded stringers. These solid laminates have 
many more plies than the face sheets of honeycomb sandwich 
structures. The flush repair techniques for solid laminate 
structures are similar for fiberglass, Kevlar®, and graphite 
with minor differences.

A flush repair can be stepped or, more commonly, scarved 
(tapered). The scarf angles are usually small to ease the load 
into the joint and to prevent the adhesive from escaping. This 
translates into thickness-to-length ratios of 1:10 to 1:70. 

Because inspection of bonded repairs is difficult, bonded 
repairs, as contrasted with bolted repairs, require a higher 
commitment to quality control, better trained personnel, 
and cleanliness.

The scarf joint is more efficient from the viewpoint of load 
transfer as it reduces load eccentricity by closely aligning 
the neutral axis of the parent and the patch. However, this 
configuration has many drawbacks in making the repair. 
First, to maintain a small taper angle, a large quantity of 
sound material must be removed. Second, the replacement 
plies must be very accurately laid up and placed in the 
repair joint. Third, curing of replacement plies can result in 
significantly reduced strength if not cured in the autoclave.

Fourth, the adhesive can run to the bottom of the joint, 
creating a nonuniform bond line. This can be alleviated by 
approximating the scarf with a series of small steps. For these 

reasons, unless the part is lightly loaded, this type of repair 
is usually performed at a repair facility where the part can be 
inserted into the autoclave, which can result in part strength 
as strong as the original part.

There are several different repair methods for solid 
laminates. The patch can be precured and then secondarily 
bonded to the parent material. This procedure most closely 
approximates the bolted repair. [Figure 7-64] The patch 
can be made from prepreg and then co-cured at the same 
time as the adhesive. The patch can also be made using a 
wet layup repair. The curing cycle can also vary in length 
of time, cure temperature, and cure pressure, increasing the 
number of possible repair combinations. 

Scarf repairs of composite laminates are performed in the 
sequence of steps described below.

Step 1: Inspection and Mapping of Damage

The size and depth of damage to be repaired must be accurately 
surveyed using appropriate nondestructive evaluation (NDE) 
techniques. A variety of NDE techniques can be used to

inspect for damage in composite structures. The simplest 
technique is visual inspection, in which whitening due to 
delamination and/or resin cracking can be used to indicate 
the damage area in semitransparent composites, such as 
glass-polyester and glass-vinyl ester laminates. 

Visual inspection is not an accurate technique because not 
all damage is detectable to the eye, particularly damage 
hidden by paint, damage located deep below the surface, and 
damage in nontransparent composites, such as carbon and 
aramid laminates. A popular technique is tap testing, in which 
a lightweight object, such as a coin or hammer, is used to 
locate damage. The main benefits of tap testing are that it is 
simple and it can be used to rapidly inspect large areas. Tap 
testing can usually be used to detect delamination damage 
close to the surface, but becomes increasingly less reliable 
the deeper the delamination is located below the surface. Tap 
testing is not useful for detecting other types of damage, such 
as resin cracks and broken fibers. 

More advanced NDE techniques for inspecting composites 
are impedance testing, x-ray radiography, thermography, 
and ultrasonics. Of these techniques, ultrasonics is arguably 
the most accurate and practical and is often used for 
surveying damage. Ultrasonics can be used to detect small 
delaminations located deep below the surface, unlike visual 
inspection and tap testing.

Step 2: Removal of Damaged Material

Once the scope of the damaged area to be repaired has 
been determined, the damaged laminate must be removed. 
The edges of the sound laminate are then tapered back to 
a shallow angle. The taper slope ratio, also known as the 
scarf angle, should be less than 12 to 1 (< 5°) to minimize 
the shear strains along the bond line after the repair patch is 
applied. The shallow angle also compensates for some errors 
in workmanship and other shop variables that might diminish 
patch adhesion. [Figure 7-65]

Step 3: Surface Preparation 

The laminate close to the scarf zone should be lightly 
abraded with sandpaper, followed by the removal of dust 
and contaminates. It is recommended that, if the scarf zone 
has been exposed to the environment for any considerable 
period of time, it should be cleaned with a solvent to remove 
contamination.

Step 4: Molding

A rigid backing plate having the original profile of the 
composite structure is needed to ensure the repair has the 
same geometry as the surrounding structure.

Step 5: Laminating

Laminated repairs are usually done using the smallest 
ply-first taper sequence. While this repair is acceptable, it 
produces relatively weak, resin-rich areas at each ply edge at 
the repair interface. The largest ply first laminate sequence, 
where the first layer of reinforcing fabric completely covers 
the work area, produces a stronger interface joint. Follow the 
manufacturer’s SRM instructions.

Selection of the reinforcing material is critical to ensuring 
the repair has acceptable mechanical performance. The 
reinforcing fabric or tape should be identical to the 
reinforcement material used in the original composite. Also, 
the fiber orientation of the reinforcing layers within the repair 
laminate should match those of the original part laminate, 
so that the mechanical properties of the repair are as close 
to original as possible.

Figure 7-67. Resin injection repair.

Step 6: Finishing

After the patch has cured, a conducting mesh and finish coat 
should be applied if needed.

Trailing Edge and Transition Area Patch Repairs
Trailing edges of control panels are highly vulnerable to 
damage. The aft 4 inches are especially subject to ground 
collision and handling, as well as to lightning strike. Repairs 
in this region can be difficult because both the skins and the 
trailing edge reinforcement may be involved. The repairs to 
a honeycomb core on a damaged edge or panel are similar to 
the repair of a sandwich honeycomb structure discussed in 
the Damage Requiring Core Replacement and Repair to One 
or Both Faceplate Repair sections. Investigate the damage, 
remove damaged plies and core, dry the part, install new core, 
layup the repair plies, curing and post inspection. A typical 
trail edge repair is shown in Figure 7-66.

Resin Injection Repairs
Resin injection repairs are used on lightly loaded structures 
for small damages to a solid laminate due to delamination. 
Two holes are drilled on the outside of the delamination area 
and a low-viscosity resin is injected in one hole until it flows 
out the other hole. Resin injection repairs are sometimes 
used on sandwich honeycomb structure to repair a facesheet 
disbond. Disadvantages of the resin injection method are that 
the fibers are cut as a result of drilling holes, it is difficult to 
remove moisture from the damaged area, and it is difficult to 
achieve complete infusion of resin. [Figure 7-67]

Composite Patch Bonded to Aluminum Structure
Composite materials can be used to structurally repair, restore, 
or enhance aluminum, steel, and titanium components. 
Bonded composite doublers have the ability to slow or 
stop fatigue crack growth, replace lost structural area due 
to corrosion grindouts, and structurally enhance areas with 
small and negative margins.

Boron epoxy, GLARE®, and graphite epoxy materials have 
been used as composite patches to restore damaged metallic 
wing skins, fuselage sections, floor beams, and bulkheads. 
As a crack growth inhibitor, the stiff bonded composite 
materials constrain the cracked area, reduce the gross stress 
in the metal, and provide an alternate load path around the 
crack. As a structural enhancement or blendout filler, the 
high modulus fiber composites offer negligible aerodynamic 
resistance and tailorable properties.

Surface preparation is very important to achieve the adhesive 
strength. Grit blast silane and phosphoric acid anodizing are 
used to prepare aluminum skin. Film adhesives using a 250 °F 
(121 °C) cure are used routinely to bond the doublers to the 
metallic structure. Critical areas of the installation process 
include a good thermal cure control, having and maintaining 
water-free bond surfaces, and chemically and physically 
prepared bond surfaces. 

Secondarily bonded precured doublers and in-situ cured 
doublers have been used on a variety of structural geometries 
ranging from fuselage frames to door cutouts to blade 
stiffeners. Vacuum bags are used to apply the bonding and 
curing pressure between the doubler and metallic surface. 

Fiberglass Molded Mat Repairs
Fiberglass molded mats consists of short fibers, and the 
strength is much less than other composite products that 
use continuous fibers. Fiberglass molded mats are not used 
for structural repair applications, but could be used for non-

structural applications. The fiberglass molded mat is typically 
used in combination with fiberglass fabric. The molded mats 
are impregnated with resin just like a wet layup for fiberglass 
fabric. The advantage of the molded mat is the lower cost 
and the ease of use.

Radome Repairs
Aircraft radomes, being an electronic window for the radar, 
are often made of nonconducting honeycomb sandwich 
structure with only three or four plies of fiberglass. The 
skins are so thin so that they do not block the radar signals. 
The thin structure, combined with the location in front of the 
aircraft, makes the radome vulnerable to hail damage, bird 
strikes, and lightning strikes. Low-impact damage could 
lead to disbonds and delamination. Often, water is found in 
the radome structure due to impact damage or erosion. The 
moisture collects in the core material and begins a freeze-
thaw cycle each time the airplane is flown. This eventually 
breaks down the honeycomb material causing a soft spot on 
the radome itself. Damage to a radome needs to be repaired 
quickly to avoid further damage and radar signal obstructions. 
Trapped water or moisture can produce a shadow on the radar 
image and severely degrade the performance of the radar. 
To detect water ingression in radomes, the available NDE 
techniques include x-ray radiography, infrared thermography, 
and a radome moisture meter that measures the RF power 
loss caused by the presence of water. The repairs to radomes 
are similar to repairs to other honeycomb structures, but the 
technician needs to realize that repairs could affect the radar 
performance. A special tool is necessary to repair severely 
damaged radomes. [Figure 7-68]

Transmissivity testing after radome repair ensures that the 
radar signal is transmitted properly through the radome. 
Radomes have lightning protections strips bonded to the 
outside of the radome to dissipate the energy of a lighting 

strike. It is important that these lightning protection strips are 
in good condition to avoid damage to the radome structure. 
Typical failures of lightning protection strips that are found 
during inspection are high resistance caused by shorts in the 
strips or attaching hardware and disbonding of the strips from 
the radome surface. [Figures 7-69] 

External Bonded Patch Repairs
Repairs to damaged composite structures can be made with an 
external patch. The external patch repair could be made with 
prepreg, a wet layup, or a precured patch. External patches 
are usually stepped to reduce the stress concentration at the 
edge of the patch. The disadvantages of the external patch are 
the eccentricity of the loading that causes peel stresses and 
the protrusion of the patch in the air stream. The advantage 
of the external patch is that it is easier to accomplish than a 
flush scarf-type repair.

External Bonded Repair With Prepreg Plies

The repair methods for carbon, fiberglass, and Kevlar® are 
similar. Fiberglass is sometimes used to repair Kevlar® 
material. The main steps in repairing damage with an external 
patch are investigating and mapping the damage, removal 
of the damage, layup of the repair plies, vacuum bagging, 
curing, and finish coating.

Step 1: Investigating and Mapping the Damage

Use the tap test or ultrasonic test to map out the damage.

Step 2: Damage Removal

Trim out the damage to a smooth round or oval shape. Use 
scotch or sand paper to rough up the parent surface at least 
1 inch larger than the patch size. Clean the surface with an 
approved solvent and cheese cloth.

Step 3: Layup of the Repair Plies

Use the SRM to determine the number, size, and orientation 
of the repair plies. The repair ply material and orientation 
must be the same as the orientation of the parent structure. 
The repair can be stepped to reduce peel stresses at the edges.

Step 4: Vacuum Bagging

A film adhesive is placed over the damaged area and the 
repair layup is placed on top of the repair. The vacuum 
bagging materials are placed on top of the repair (see Prepreg 
Layup and Controlled Bleed Out) and a vacuum is applied.

Step 5: Curing the Repair

The prepreg patch can be cured with a heater blanket that is 
placed inside the vacuum bag, oven, or autoclave when the 
part can be removed from the aircraft. Most prepregs and 
film adhesives cure at either 250 °F or 350 °F. Consult the 
SRM for the correct cure cycle.

Step 6: Applying Top Coat

Remove the vacuum bag from the repair after the cure 
and inspect the repair, remove the patch if the repair 
is not satisfactory. Lightly sand the repair and apply a  
protective topcoating.

External Repair Using Wet Layup and Double Vacuum 
Debulk Method (DVD)

Generally, the properties of a wet layup repair are not as good 
as a repair with prepreg material; but by using a DVD method, 
the properties of the wet layup process can be improved. The 
DVD process is a technique to remove entrapped air that 
causes porosity in wet layup laminates. The DVD process 
is often used to make patches for solid laminate structures 
for complex contoured surfaces. The wet layup patch is 
prepared in a DVD tool and then secondary bonded to the 
aircraft structure. [Figure 7-70] The laminating process is 
similar to a standard wet layup process. The difference is 
how the patch is cured.

Double Vacuum Debulk Principle

The double vacuum bag process is used to fabricate wet layup 
or prepreg repair laminates. Place the impregnated fabric 
within the debulking assembly, shown in Figure 7-70. To 

begin the debulking process, evacuate the air within the inner 
flexible vacuum bag. Then, seal the rigid outer box onto the 
inner vacuum bag, and evacuate the volume of air between 
the rigid outer box and inner vacuum bag. Since the outer 
box is rigid, the second evacuation prevents atmospheric 
pressure from pressing down on the inner vacuum bag over 
the patch. This subsequently prevents air bubbles from being 
pinched off within the laminate and facilitates air removal by 
the inner vacuum. Next, heat the laminate to a predetermined 
debulking temperature in order to reduce the resin viscosity 
and further improve the removal of air and volatiles from 
the laminate. Apply the heat through a heat blanket that is 
controlled with thermocouples placed directly on the heat 
blanket. Once the debulking cycle is complete, compact the 
laminate to consolidate the plies by venting the vacuum source 
attached to the outer rigid box, allowing atmospheric pressure 
to reenter the box and provide positive pressure against the 
inner vacuum bag. Upon completion of the compaction cycle, 
remove the laminate from the assembly and prepare for cure.

DVD tools can be purchased commercially but can also be 
fabricated locally from wood two-by-fours and sheets of 
plywood, as illustrated in Figure 7-70.

Patch Installation on the Aircraft

After the patch comes out of the DVD tool, it is still possible 
to form it to the contour of the aircraft, but the time is 
typically limited to 10 minutes. Place a film adhesive, or 
paste adhesive, on the aircraft skin and place the patch on 
the aircraft. Use a vacuum bag and heater blanket to cure the 
adhesive. [Figures 7-71 and 7-72]

External Repair Using Precured Laminate Patches

Precured patches are not very flexible and cannot be used 
on highly curved or compound curved surfaces. The repair 
steps are similar as in External Bonded Repair With Prepreg 
Plies, except step 3 and 4 that follow.

Step 4: For a Precured Patch

Apply film adhesive or paste adhesive to the damaged area 
and place the precured patch on top. Vacuum bag the repair 
and cure at the correct temperature for the film adhesive or 
paste adhesive. Most film adhesive cure at either 250 °F 
or 350 °F. Some paste adhesives cure at room temperature 
although an elevated temperature could be used to speed the 
curing process.

Bonded versus Bolted Repairs

Bonded repair concepts have found applicability in both 
types of manufacturing assembly methods. They have the 
advantage of not introducing stress concentrations by drilling 
fastener holes for patch installation and can be stronger than 
original part material. The disadvantage of bonded repairs is 
that most repair materials require special storage, handling, 
and curing procedures. 

Bolted repairs are quicker and easier to fabricate than 
bonded repairs. They are normally used on composite skins 
thicker than 0.125-inch to ensure sufficient fastener bearing 
area is available for load transfer. They are prohibited in 
honeycomb sandwich assemblies due to the potential for 
moisture intrusion from the fastener holes and the resulting 
core degradation. Bolted repairs are heavier than comparable 
bonded repairs, limiting their use on weight-sensitive flight 
control surfaces.

Honeycomb sandwich parts often have thin face sheets 
and are most effectively repaired by using a bonded scarf 
type repair. A bonded external step patch can be used as an 
alternative. Bolted repairs are not effective for thin laminates 
because of the low bearing stress of the composite laminate. 
Thicker solid laminates used on larger aircraft can be up 
to an inch thick in highly loaded areas and these types of 
laminates cannot be effectively repaired using a bonded scarf 
type repair. [Figure 7-74]

Bolted Repairs
Aircraft designed in the 1970s used composite sandwich 
honeycomb structure for lightly loaded secondary structure, 
but new large aircraft use thick solid laminates for primary 
structure instead of sandwich honeycomb. These thick solid 
laminate structures are quite different from the traditional 
sandwich honeycomb structures used for flight controls, 
landing gear doors, flaps, and spoilers of today’s aircraft. 
They present a challenge to repair and are difficult to repair 
with a bonded repair method. Bolted repair methods have 
been developed to repair thicker solid laminates.

Bolted repairs are not desirable for honeycomb sandwich 
structure due to the limited bearing strength of the thin face 
sheets and weakened honeycomb structure from drilling 

holes. The advantage of a bolted repair is that you need 
to select only patch material and fasteners, and the repair 
method is similar to a sheet metal repair. There is no need 
for curing the repair and storing the prepreg repair material 
and film adhesives in a freezer. Patches may be made from 
aluminum, titanium, steel, or precured composite material. 
Composite patches are often made from carbon fiber with an 
epoxy resin or fiberglass with an epoxy resin.

You can repair a carbon fiber structure with an aluminum 
patch, but you must place a layer of fiberglass cloth between 
the carbon part and the aluminum patch to prevent galvanic 
corrosion. Titanium and precured composite patches are 
preferred for repair of highly loaded components. Precured 
carbon/epoxy patches have the same strength and stiffness 
as the parent material as they are usually cured similarly. 

Titanium or stainless steel fasteners are used for bolted repairs 
of a carbon fiber structure. Aluminum fasteners corrode if 
used with carbon fiber. Rivets cannot be used because the 
installation of rivets using a rivet gun introduce damage to 
the hole and surrounding structure and rivets expand during 
installation, which is undesirable for composite structures 
because it could cause delimination of the composite material.

Repair Procedures

Step 1: Inspection of the Damage

The tap test is not effective to detect delamination in thick 
laminates unless the damage is close to the surface. An

Three rows of fasteners are required

Edge distamce is three times the diameter of the fastener

Spacing four to six times the diameter of the fastener

Damage is cut out to a smooth rectangular shape

Radius of repair plate corner is 0.5""

Figure 7-75. Repair layout for bolted repair of composite structure.

ultrasonic inspection is necessary to determine the damage 
area. Consult the SRM to find an applicable NDI procedure. 

Step 2: Removal of the Damage

The damaged area needs to be trimmed to a round or 
rectangular hole with large smooth radii to prevent stress 
concentrations. Remove the damage with a sander, router, 
or similar tool.

Step 3: Patch Preparation

Determine the size of the patch based on repair information 
found in the SRM. Cut, form, and shape the patch before 
attaching the patch to the damaged structure. It is easier to 
make the patch a little bigger than calculated and trim to 
size after drilling all fastener holes. In some cases, the repair 
patches are stocked preshaped and predrilled. If cutting is to 
be performed, standard shop procedures should be used that 
are suitable for the patch material. Titanium is hard to work 
and requires a large powerful slip roller to curve the material. 
Metal patches require filing to prevent crack initiation around 
the cut edges. When drilling pilot holes in the composite, 
the holes for repair fasteners must be a minimum of four 
diameters from existing fasteners and have a minimum edge 
distance of three fastener diameters. This is different from the 
standard practice for aluminum of allowing a two diameter 
distance. Specific pilot hole sizes and drill types to be used 
should follow specific SRM instructions. [Figure 7-75]

Step 4: Hole Pattern Lay Out

To locate the patch on the damaged area, draw two 
perpendicular centerlines on the parent structure and on the 
patch material that define the principal load or geometric 
directions. Then, lay out hole pattern on the patch and drill 
pilot holes in the patch material. Align the two perpendicular 

centerlines of the patch with the lines on the parent structure 
and transfer the pilot holes to the parent material. Use clecos 
to keep the patch in place. Mark the edges of the patch so that 
it can be returned to the same location easily. 

Step 5: Drilling and Reaming Holes in Patch and Parent 
Structure

Composite skins should be backed up to prevent splitting. 
Enlarge the pilot holes in the patch and parent materials with 
a drill 1⁄64 undersize and then ream all holes to the correct size. 
A tolerance of +0.0025/–0.000-inch is usually recommended 
for aircraft parts. For composites, this means interference 
fasteners are not used. 

Step 6: Fastener Installation

Once fastener holes are drilled full size and reamed, 
permanent fasteners are installed. Before installation, 
measure the fastener grip length for each fastener using a 
grip length gauge. As different fasteners are required for 
different repairs, consult the SRM for permissible fastener 
type and installation procedure. However, install all fasteners 
wet with sealant and with proper torque for screws and bolts.

Step 7: Sealing of Fasteners and Patch

Sealants are applied to bolted repairs for prevention of water/
moisture intrusion, chemical damage, galvanic corrosion, 
and fuel leaks. They also provide contour smoothness. The 
sealant must be applied to a clean surface. Masking tape is 
usually placed around the periphery of the patch, parallel 
with the patch edges and leaving a small gap between the 
edge of the patch and the masking tape. Sealing compound 
is applied into this gap.

Figure 7-76. ASP fastener system. 

Step 8: Application of Finish Coat and Lightning Protection 
Mesh

The repair needs to be sanded, primed, and painted with an 
approved paint system. A lightning protection mesh needs 
to be applied if composite patches are used in an area that is 
prone to lightning strikes.

Fasteners Used with Composite Laminates
Many companies make specialty fasteners for composite 
structures and several types of fasteners are commonly used: 
threaded fasteners, lock bolts, blind bolts, blind rivets, and 
specialty fasteners for soft structures, such as honeycomb 
panels. The main differences between fasteners for metal 
and composite structures are the materials and the footprint 
diameter of nuts and collars. 

Corrosion Precautions
Neither fiberglass nor Kevlar® fiber-reinforced composites 
cause corrosion problems when used with most fastener 
materials. Composites reinforced with carbon fibers, 
however, are quite cathodic when used with materials, such 
as aluminum or cadmium, the latter of which is a common 
plating used on fasteners for corrosion protection.

Fastener Materials 
Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V is the most common alloy for 
fasteners used with carbon fiber reinforced composite 
structures. Austenitic stainless steels, superalloys (e.g., 
A286), multiphase alloys (e.g., MP35N or MP159), and 
nickel alloys (e.g., alloy 718) also appear to be very 
compatible with carbon fiber composites.
  
Fastener System for Sandwich Honeycomb 
Structures (SPS Technologies Comp Tite)
The adjustable sustain preload (ASP) fastening system 
provides a simplified method of fastening composite, 
soft core, metallic or other materials, which are sensitive 
to fastener clamp-up or installation force conditions. 
Clamping force can be infinitely adjustable within maximum 
recommended torque limits and no further load is applied 
during installation of the lock collar. The fastener is available 
in two types. The ASP® has full shank and the 2ASP® has a 
pilot type shank. [Figures 7-76 and 7-77]

Hi-Lok® and Huck-Spin® Lockbolt Fasteners
Most composite primary structures for the aircraft industry 
are fastened with Hi-Loks® (Hi-Shear Corp.) or Huck-
Spin® lockbolts for permanent installations. The Hi-Lok® 
is a threaded fastener that incorporates a hex key in the 
threaded end to react to the torque applied to the collar 
during installation. The collar includes a frangible portion 
that separates at a predetermined torque value. [Figure 7-78]

The lockbolt incorporates a collar that is swaged into annular 
grooves. It comes in two types: pull and stump. The pull-
type is the most common, where a frangible pintail is used to 
react the axial load during the swaging of the collar. When 
the swaging load reaches a predetermined limit, the pintail 
breaks away at the breakneck groove. The installation of 
the Hi-Lok® and the pull-type Huck-Spin® lockbolt can be 
performed by one technician from one side of the structure. 
The stump-type lockbolt, on the other hand, requires support 
on the head side of the fastener to react the swage operation. 
This method is usually reserved for automated assembly of 
detail structure in which access is not a problem.

The specific differences in these fasteners for composite 
structure in contrast to metal structure are small. For the 
Hi-Lok®, material compatibility is the only issue; aluminum 
collars are not recommended. Standard collars of A286, 
303 stainless steel, and titanium alloy are normally used. 
The Huck-Spin® lockbolt requires a hat-shaped collar that 
incorporates a flange to spread the high bearing loads during 
installation. The lockbolt pin designed for use in composite 
structure has six annular grooves as opposed to five for metal 
structure. [Figures 7-79 and 7-80]

Eddie-Bolt® Fasteners
Eddie-Bolt® fasteners (Alcoa) are similar in design to Hi-
Loks® and are a natural choice for carbon fiber composite 
structures. The Eddie-Bolt® pin is designed with flutes in 
the threaded portion, which allow a positive lock to be made 
during installation using a specially designed mating nut or 
collar. The mating nut has three lobes that serve as driving 
ribs. During installation, at a predetermined preload, the lobes

compress the nut material into the flutes of the pin and form 
the locking feature. The advantage for composite structure 
is that titanium alloy nuts can be used for compatibility and 
weight saving without the fear of galling. The nuts spin on 
freely, and the locking feature is established at the end of the 
installation cycle. [Figure 7-81]

Cherry’s E-Z Buck® (CSR90433) Hollow Rivet
The Cherry Hollow End E-Z Buck® rivet is made from 
titanium/columbium alloy and has a shear strength of 40 KSI. 
The E-Z Buck® rivet is designed to be used in a double flush 
application for fuel tanks. The main advantage of this type 
of rivet is that it takes less than half the force of a solid rivet 
of the same material. The rivets are installed with automated 
riveting equipment or a rivet squeezer. Special optional 
dies ensure that the squeezer is always centered during 
installation, avoiding damage to the structure. [Figure 7-82]

Blind Fasteners
Composite structures do not require as many fasteners as 
metal aircraft because stiffeners and doublers are co-cured 
with the skins, eliminating many fasteners. The size of panels 
on aircraft has increased in composite structures, which 
causes backside inaccessibility. Therefore, blind fasteners 
or screws and nutplates must be used in these areas. Many 
manufacturers make blind fasteners for composite structures; 
a few are discussed below.

Blind Bolts 
The Cherry Maxibolt® is available in titanium for 
compatibility with composite structures. The shear strength 
of the Maxibolt® is 95 KSI. It can be installed from one side 
with a G-83 or equivalent pneumatic-hydraulic installation 
tool, and is available in 100° flush head, 130° flush head and 
protruding head styles. [Figure 7-83]

The Alcoa UAB™ blind bolt system is designed for composite 
structures and is available in titanium and stainless steel. The 
UAB™ blind bolt system is available in 100° flush head, 130° 
flush head, and protruding head styles.

The Accu-Lok™ Blind Fastening System is designed 
specifically for use in composite structures in which access 
is limited to one side of the structure. It combines high joint 
preload with a large diameter footprint on the blind side. 
The large footprint enables distribution of the joint preload 
over a larger area, virtually eliminating the possibility of 
delaminating the composite structure. The shear strength of 
the Accu-Lok™ is 95 KSI, and it is available in 100° flush 
head, 130° flush head, and protruding head styles. A similar 
fastener designed by Monogram is called the Radial-Lok®. 
[Figure 7-84]

Fiberlite
The fiberlite fastening system uses composite materials for a 
wide range of aerospace hardware. The strength of fiberlite 
fasteners is equivalent to aluminum at two-thirds the weight. 
The composite fastener provides good material compatibility 
with carbon fiber and fiberglass.

Screws and Nutplates in Composite Structures
The use of screws and nutplates in place of Hi-Loks® or 
blind fasteners is recommended if a panel must be removed 
periodically for maintenance. Nutplates used in composite 
structures usually require three holes: two for attachment 
of the nutplate and one for the removable screw, although 
rivetless nut plates and adhesive bonded nutplates are 
available that do not require drilling and countersinking two 
extra holes.

Machining Processes and Equipment
Drilling
Hole drilling in composite materials is different from drilling 
holes in metal aircraft structures. Different types of drill bits, 
higher speeds, and lower feeds are required to drill precision 
holes. Structures made from carbon fiber and epoxy resin 
are very hard and abrasive, requiring special flat flute drills 
or similar four-flute drills. Aramid fiber (Kevlar®)/epoxy 
composites are not as hard as carbon but are difficult to 
drill unless special cutters are used because the fibers tend 
to fray or shred unless they are cut clean while embedded 
in the epoxy. Special drill bits with clothes pin points and 
fish-tail points have been developed that slice the fibers prior 
to pulling them out of the drilled hole. If the Kevlar®/epoxy 
part is sandwiched between two metal parts, standard twist 
drills can be used.

Equipment

Air-driven tools are used for drilling holes in composite 
materials. Drill motors with free speed of up to 20,000 rpm 
are used. A general rule for drilling composites is to use high 
speed and a low feed rate (pressure). Drilling equipment 
with a power feed control produces better hole quality than 
drill motors without power feed control. Drill guides are 
recommended, especially for thicker laminates. 

Do not use standard twist drill bits for drilling composite 
structures. Standard high-speed steel is unacceptable, because 
it dulls immediately, generates excessive heat, and causes ply 
delamination, fiber tear-out, and unacceptable hole quality.

Drill bits used for carbon fiber and fiberglass are made from 
diamond-coated material or solid carbide because the fibers

are so hard that standard high-speed steel (HSS) drill bits 
do not last long. Typically, twist drills are used, but brad 
point drills are also available. The Kevlar® fibers are not 
as hard as carbon, and standard HSS drill bits can be used. 
The hole quality can be poor if standard drill bits are used 
and the preferred drill style is the sickle-shaped Klenk drill. 
This drill first pulls on the fibers and then shears them, 
which results in a better quality hole. Larger holes can 
be cut with diamond-coated hole saws or fly cutters, but 
only use fly cutters in a drill press, and not in a drill motor.

Processes and Precautions

Composite materials are drilled with drill motors operating 
between 2,000 and 20,000 rpm and a low feed rate. Drill 
motors with a hydraulic dash pod or other type of feed control 
are preferred because they restrict the surging of the drill 
as it exits the composite materials. This reduces breakout 
damage and delaminations. Parts made from tape products 
are especially susceptible to breakout damage; parts made 
from fabric material have experienced less damage. The 
composite structure needs to be backed with a metal plate 
or sheet to avoid breakout. Holes in composite structures 

are often predrilled with a small pilot hole, enlarged with a 
diamond-coated or carbide drill bit and reamed with a carbide 
reamer to final hole size. 

Back counterboring is a condition that can occur when 
carbon/epoxy parts mate metal substructure parts. The back 
edge of the hole in the carbon/epoxy part can be eroded or 
radiused by metal chips being pulled through the composite. 
The condition is more prevalent when there are gaps between 
the parts or when the metal debris is stringy rather than small 
chips. Back counterboring can be minimized or eliminated 
by changing feeds and speeds, cutter geometry, better part 
clamp-up adding a final ream pass, using a peck drill, or 
combination of these. 

When drilling combinations of composite parts with metal 
parts, the metal parts may govern the drilling speed. For 
example, even though titanium is compatible with carbon/
epoxy material from a corrosion perspective, lower drilling 
speeds are required in order to ensure no metallurgical 
damage occurs to the titanium. Titanium is drilled with low 
speed and high feed. Drill bits suitable for titanium might not 
be suitable for carbon or fiberglass. Drill bits that are used 
for drilling titanium are often made from cobalt-vanadium; 
drill bits used for carbon fiber are made from carbide or 
are diamond coated to increase drill life and to produce an 
accurate hole. Small-diameter high-speed steel drill bits, such 
as No. 40 drill, which are used to manually drill pilot holes, 
are typically used because carbide drills are relatively brittle 
and are easily broken. The relatively low cost of these small 
HSS drill bits offsets the limited life expectancy. High-speed 
steel drill bits may last for only one hole. 

The most common problem with carbide cutters used in hand-
drill operations is handling damage (chipped edges) to the 
cutters. A sharp drill with a slow constant feed can produce 
a 0.1 mm (0.004-inch) tolerance hole through carbon/epoxy 
plus thin aluminum, especially if a drill guide is used. With 
hard tooling, tighter tolerances can be maintained. When the 
structure under the carbon/epoxy is titanium, drills can pull 
titanium chips through the carbon/epoxy and enlarge the hole. 
In this case, a final ream operation may be required to hold 
tight hole tolerances. Carbide reamers are needed for holes 
through carbon/epoxy composite structure. In addition, the 
exit end of the hole needs good support to prevent splintering 
and delaminations when the reamer removes more than 
about 0.13 mm (0.005-inch) on the diameter. The support 
can be the substructure or a board held firmly against the 
back surface. Typical reaming speeds are about one-half of 
the drilling speed.


7-52

Cutting fluids are not normally used or recommended for 
drilling thin (less than 6.3 mm, or 0.25-inch thick) carbon/
epoxy structure. It is good practice to use a vacuum while 
drilling in composite materials to avoid that carbon dust freely 
floats around the work area. 

Countersinking
Countersinking a composite structure is required when 
flush head fasteners are to be installed in the assembly. For 
metallic structures, a 100° included angle shear or tension 
head fastener has been the typical approach. In composite 
structures, two types of fastener are commonly used: a 100° 
included angle tension head fastener or a 130° included angle 
head fastener. The advantage of the 130° head is that the 
fastener head can have about the same diameter as a tension 
head 100° fastener with the head depth of a shear-type head 
100° fastener. For seating flush fasteners in composite parts, 
it is recommended that the countersink cutters be designed 
to produce a controlled radius between the hole and the 
countersink to accommodate the head-to-shank fillet radius 
on the fasteners. In addition, a chamfer operation or a washer 
may be required to provide proper clearance for protruding 
head fastener head-to-shank radii. Whichever head style is 
used, a matching countersink/chamfer must be prepared in 
the composite structure. 

Carbide cutters are used for producing a countersink in 
carbon/epoxy structure. These countersink cutters usually 
have straight flutes similar to those used on metals. For 
Kevlar® fiber/epoxy composites, S-shaped positive rake 
cutting flutes are used. If straight-fluted countersink cutters 
are used, a special thick tape can be applied to the surface 
to allow for a clean cutting of the Kevlar® fibers, but this 
is not as effective as the S-shaped fluted cutters. Use of a 
piloted countersink cutter is recommended because it ensures 
better concentricity between the hole and the countersink and 
decreases the possibility of gaps under the fasteners due to 
misalignment or delaminations of the part. 

Use a microstop countersink gauge to produce consistent 
countersink wells. Do not countersink through more than 70 
percent of the skin depth because a deeper countersink well 
reduces material strength. When a piloted countersink cutter 
is used, the pilot must be periodically checked for wear, as 
wear can cause reduction of concentricity between the hole 
and countersink. This is especially true for countersink cutters 
with only one cutting edge. For piloted countersink cutters, 
position the pilot in the hole and bring the cutter to full rpm 
before beginning to feed the cutter into the hole and preparing 
the countersink. If the cutter is in contact with the composite 
before triggering the drill motor, you may get splintering.

Cutting Processes and Precautions
Cutters that work well for metals would either have a short 
life or produce a poorly cut edge if used for composite 
materials. The cutters that are used for composites vary with 
the composite material that is being cut. The general rule for 
cutting composites is high speed and slow feed.

• Carbon fiber reinforced plastics: Carbon fiber is very 
hard and quickly wears out high speed steel cutters. 
For most trimming and cutting tasks, diamond grit 
cutters are best. Aluminum-oxide or silicon-carbide 
sandpaper or cloth is used for sanding. Silicon-carbide 
lasts longer then aluminum-oxide. Router bits can also 
be made from solid carbide or diamond coated.

• Glass fiber reinforced plastics: Glass fibers, like 
carbon, are very hard and quickly wear out high-speed 
steel cutters. Fiberglass is drilled with the same type 
and material drill bits as carbon fiber. 

• Aramid (Kevlar®) fiber-reinforced plastics: Aramid 
fiber is not as hard as carbon and glass fiber, and cutters 
made from high-speed steel can be used. To prevent 
loose fibers at the edge of aramid composites, hold 
the part and then cut with a shearing action. Aramid 
composites need to be supported with a plastic backup 
plate. The aramid and backup plate are cut through at 
the same time. Aramid fibers are best cut by being 
held in tension and then sheared. There are specially 
shaped cutters that pull on the fibers and then shear 
them. When using scissors to cut aramid fabric or 
prepreg, they must have a shearing edge on one blade 
and a serrated or grooved surface on the other. These 
serrations hold the material from slipping. Sharp blades 
should always be used as they minimize fiber damage. 
Always clean the scissor serrations immediately after 
use so the uncured resin does not ruin the scissors.

Always use safety glasses and other protective equipment 
when using tools and equipment.

Cutting Equipment
The bandsaw is the equipment that is most often used in 
a repair shop for cutting composite materials. A toothless 
carbide or diamond-coated saw blade is recommended. A 
typical saw blade with teeth does not last long if carbon fiber 
or fiberglass is cut. [Figure 7-88] Air-driven hand tools, 
such as routers, saber saws, die grinders, and cut-off wheels 
can be used to trim composite parts. Carbide or diamond-
coated cutting tools produce a better finish and they last 
much longer. Specialized shops have ultrasonic, waterjet, 
and laser cutters. These types of equipment are numerical 
controlled (NC) and produce superior edge and hole quality. 


7-53

Figure 7-88. Bandsaw. 

Figure 7-89. Gerber cutting table.

A waterjet cutter cannot be used for honeycomb structure 
because it introduces water in the part. Do not cut anything 
else on equipment that is used for composites because other 
materials can contaminate the composite material.

Prepreg materials can be cut with a CNC Gerber table. 
The use of this equipment speeds up the cutting process 
and optimizes the use of the material. Design software is 
available that calculates how to cut plies for complex shapes. 
[Figures 7-89]

Repair Safety
Advanced composite materials including prepreg, resin 
systems, cleaning solvents, and adhesives could be 
hazardous, and it is important that you use personal protection 
equipment. It is important to read and understand the Safety 
Data Sheets (SDS) and handle all chemicals, resins, and 
fibers correctly. The SDS lists the hazardous chemicals in 
the material system, and it outlines the hazards. The material 
could be a respiratory irritant or carcinogenic, or another kind 
of dangerous substance.

Eye Protection
Always protect eyes from chemicals and flying objects. Wear 
safety glasses at all times and, when mixing or pouring acids, 
wear a face shield. Never wear corrective contact lenses in a 
shop, even with safety glasses. Some of the chemical solvents 
can melt the lenses and damage eyes. Dust can also get under 
the lenses, causing damage.

Respiratory Protection
Do not breathe carbon fiber dust and always ensure that there 
is a good flow of air where the work is performed. Always use 
equipment to assist in breathing when working in a confined 
space. Use a vacuum near the source of the dust to remove 
the dust from the air. When sanding or applying paint, you 
need a dust mask or a respirator. A properly fitted dust mask 
provides the protection needed. For application of paints, a 
sealed respirator with the correct filters or a fresh air supply 
respirator is required. 

Downdraft Tables

A downdraft table is an efficient and economical device for 
protecting workers from harmful dust caused by sanding and 
grinding operations. The tables are also useful housekeeping 
tools because the majority of particulate material generated 
by machining operations is immediately collected for 
disposal. Downdraft tables should be sized and maintained 
to have an average face velocity between 100 and 150 cubic 
feet per minute. The downdraft table draws contaminants 
like dust and fibers away from the operator’s material. 
Downdraft tables should be monitored and filters changed 
on a regular basis to provide maximum protection and 
particulate collection.

Skin Protection
During composite repair work, protect your skin from 
hazardous materials. Chemicals could remain on hands that 
burn sensitive skin. Always wear gloves and clothing that 
offer protection against toxic materials. Use only approved 
gloves that protect skin and do not contaminate the composite 
material. Always wash hands prior to using the toilet or 
eating. Damaged composite components should be handled 
with care. Single fibers can easily penetrate the skin, splinter 
off, and become lodged in the skin.

Fire Protection
Most solvents are flammable. Close all solvent containers and 
store in a fireproof cabinet when not in use. Make sure that 
solvents are kept away from areas where static electricity can 
occur. Static electricity can occur during sanding operations 
or when bagging material is unrolled. It is preferable to use 
air-driven tools. If electric tools are used, ensure that they 
are the enclosed type. Do not mix too much resin. The resin

could overheat and start smoking caused by the exothermic 
process. Ensure that a fire extinguisher is always nearby.
 
Transparent Plastics
Plastics cover a broad field of organic synthetic resin and 
may be divided into two main classifications: thermoplastics 
and thermosetting plastics.

a. Thermoplastics—may be softened by heat and can be 
dissolved in various organic solvents. Acrylic plastic 
is commonly used as a transparent thermoplastic 
material for windows, canopies, etc. Acrylic plastics 
are known by the trade names of Lucite® or Plexiglas® 
and by the British as Perspex®, and meet the military 
specifications of MIL-P-5425 for regular acrylic and 
MIL-P-8184 for craze-resistant acrylic.

b. Thermosetting plastics—do not soften appreciably 
under heat but may char and blister at temperatures 
of 240–260 °C (400–500 °F). Most of the molded 
products of synthetic resin composition, such 
as phenolic, urea-formaldehyde, and melamine 
formaldehyde resins, belong to the thermosetting 
group. Once the plastic becomes hard, additional heat 
does not change it back into a liquid as it would with 
a thermoplastic.

Optical Considerations
Scratches and other types of damage that obstruct the vision 
of the pilots are not acceptable. Some types of damage might 
be acceptable at the edges of the windshield.

Identification
Storage and Handling
Because transparent thermoplastic sheets soften and deform 
when they are heated, they must be stored where the 
temperature never becomes excessive. Store them in a cool, 
dry location away from heating coils, radiators, or steam 
pipes, and away from such fumes as are found in paint spray 
booths or paint storage areas.

Keep paper-masked transparent sheets out of the direct rays 
of the sun, because sunlight accelerates deterioration of the 
adhesive, causing it to bond to the plastic, and making it 
difficult to remove.

Store plastic sheets with the masking paper in place, in bins 
that are tilted at a 10° angle from the vertical to prevent 
buckling. If the sheets are stored horizontally, take care to 
avoid getting dirt and chips between them. Stacks of sheets 
must never be over 18 inches high, with the smallest sheets 
stacked on top of the larger ones so there is no unsupported 
overhang. Leave the masking paper on the sheets as long as 

possible, and take care not to scratch or gouge the sheets by 
sliding them against each other or across rough or dirty tables.

Store formed sections with ample support so they do not 
lose their shape. Vertical nesting should be avoided. Protect 
formed parts from temperatures higher than 120 °F (49 °C), 
and leave their protective coating in place until they are 
installed on the aircraft.

Forming Procedures and Techniques
Transparent acrylic plastics get soft and pliable when they 
are heated to their forming temperatures and can be formed 
to almost any shape. When they cool, they retain the shape 
to which they were formed. Acrylic plastic may be cold-bent 
into a single curvature if the material is thin and the bending 
radius is at least 180 times the thickness of the sheet. Cold 
bending beyond these limits impose so much stress on the 
surface of the plastic that tiny fissures or cracks, called 
crazing, form.

Heating
Wear cotton gloves when handling the plastic to eliminate 
finger marks on the soft surface. Before heating any 
transparent plastic material, remove all of the masking paper 
and adhesive from the sheet. If the sheet is dusty or dirty, 
wash it with clean water and rinse it well. Dry the sheet 
thoroughly by blotting it with soft absorbent paper towels.

For the best results when hot forming acrylics, adhere to 
the temperatures recommended by the manufacturer. Use 
a forced-air oven that can operate over a temperature range 
of 120–374 °F (49–190 °C). If the part gets too hot during 
the forming process, bubbles may form on the surface and 
impair the optical qualities of the sheet.

For uniform heating, it is best to hang the sheets vertically by 
grasping them by their edges with spring clips and suspending 
the clips in a rack. [Figure 7-90] If the piece is too small to 
hold with clips, or if there is not enough trim area, lay the 


7-55

sheets on shelves or racks covered with soft felt or flannel. Be 
sure there is enough open space to allow the air to circulate 
around the sheet and heat it evenly.

Small forming jobs, such as landing light covers, may be 
heated in a kitchen baking oven. Infrared heat lamps may be 
used if they are arranged on 7- to 8-inch centers and enough 
of them are used in a bank to heat the sheet evenly. Place the 
lamps about 18-inches from the material.

Never use hot water or steam directly on the plastic to heat 
it because this likely causes the acrylic to become milky or 
cloudy.

Forms
Heated acrylic plastic molds with almost no pressure, so the 
forms used can be of very simple construction. Forms made 
of pressed wood, plywood, or plaster are adequate to form 
simple curves, but reinforced plastic or plaster may be needed 
to shape complex or compound curves. Since hot plastic 
conforms to any waviness or unevenness, the form used must 
be completely smooth. To ensure this, sand the form and 
cover it with soft cloth, such as outing flannel or billiard felt. 
The mold should be large enough to extend beyond the trim 
line of the part, and provisions should be made for holding 
the hot plastic snug against the mold as it cools.

A mold can be made for a complex part by using the damaged 
part itself. If the part is broken, tape the pieces together, wax 
or grease the inside so the plaster does not stick to it, and 
support the entire part in sand. Fill the part with plaster and 
allow it to harden, and then remove it from the mold. Smooth 
out any roughness and cover it with soft cloth. It is now ready 
to use to form the new part.

Forming Methods
Simple Curve Forming

Heat the plastic material to the recommended temperature, 
remove it from the heat source, and carefully drape it over 
the prepared form. Carefully press the hot plastic to the form 
and either hold or clamp the sheet in place until it cools. This 
process may take from 10–30 minutes. Do not force cool it.

Compound Curve Forming

Compound curve forming is normally used for canopies or 
complex wingtip light covers, and it requires a great deal 
of specialized equipment. There are four commonly used 
methods, each having its advantages and disadvantages.

Stretch Forming

Preheated acrylic sheets are stretched mechanically over the 
form in much the same way as is done with the simple curved 

piece. Take special care to preserve uniform thickness of the 
material, since some parts must stretch more than others.

Male and Female Die Forming

Male and female die forming requires expensive matching 
male and female dies. The heated plastic sheet is placed 
between the dies that are then mated. When the plastic cools, 
the dies are opened.

Vacuum Forming Without Forms

Many aircraft canopies are formed by this method. In this 
process, a panel, which has cut into it the outline of the desired 
shape, is attached to the top of a vacuum box. The heated 
and softened sheet of plastic is then clamped on top of the 
panel. When the air in the box is evacuated, the outside air 
pressure forces the hot plastic through the opening and forms 
the concave canopy. It is the surface tension of the plastic 
that shapes the canopy.

Vacuum Forming With a Female Form

If the shape needed is other than that which would be formed 
by surface tension, a female mold, or form must be used. It 
is placed below the plastic sheet and the vacuum pump is 
connected. When air from the form is evacuated, the outside 
air pressure forces the hot plastic sheet into the mold and fills it.

Sawing and Drilling
Sawing
Several types of saws can be used with transparent plastics; 
however, circular saws are the best for straight cuts. 
The blades should be hollow ground or have some set to 
prevent binding. After the teeth are set, they should be side 
dressed to produce a smooth edge on the cut. Band saws are 
recommended for cutting flat acrylic sheets when the cuts 
must be curved or where the sheet is cut to a rough dimension 
to be trimmed later. Close control of size and shape may be 
obtained by band sawing a piece to within 1⁄16-inch of the 
desired size, as marked by a scribed line on the plastic, and 
then sanding it to the correct size with a drum or belt sander.

Drilling
Unlike soft metal, acrylic plastic is a very poor conductor of 
heat. Make provisions for removing the heat when drilling. 
Deep holes need cooling, and water-soluble cutting oil is a 
satisfactory coolant since it has no tendency to attack the 
plastic.

The drill used on acrylics must be carefully ground and free 
from nicks and burrs that would affect the surface finish. 
Grind the drill with a greater included angle than would be 
used for soft metal. The rake angle should be zero in order 
to scrape, and not cut. The length of the cutting edge (and

hence the width of the lip) can be reduced by increasing the 
included angle of the drill. [Figure 7-91] Whenever holes are 
drilled completely through acrylic, the standard twist drills 
should be modified to a 60° tip angle, the cutting edge to a 
zero rake angle, and the back lip clearance angle increased 
to 12-15°. Drills specially modified for drilling acrylic are 
available from authorized distributors and dealers.

The patented Unibit® is good for drilling small holes in 
aircraft windshields and windows. [Figure 7-92] It can cut 
holes from 1⁄8 to ½-inch in 1⁄32-inch increments and produces 
good smooth holes with no stress cracks around their edges.

Cementing
Polymerizable cements are those in which a catalyst is added 
to an already thick monomer-polymer syrup to promote 
rapid hardening. Cement PS-30® and Weld-On 40® are 
polymerizable cements of this type. They are suitable for 
cementing all types of plexiglas acrylic cast sheet and parts 
molded from plexiglas molding pellets. At room temperature, 
the cements harden (polymerize) in the container in about 
45 minutes after mixing the components. They harden more 
rapidly at higher temperatures. The cement joints are usually 
hard enough for handling within 4 hours after assembly. The 
joints may be machined within 4 hours after assembly, but it 
is better to wait 24 hours.

Application of Cement
PS-30® and Weld-On 40® joints retain excellent appearance 
and color stability after outdoor exposure. These cements 
produce clear, transparent joints and should be used when 
the color and appearance of the joints are important.

PS-30® and Weld-On 40® should be used at temperatures 
no lower than 65 °F. If cementing is done in a room cooler 
than 65 °F, it requires a longer time to harden and the joint 
strength is reduced.

The cement should be prepared with the correct proportions 
of components as given in the manufacturer’s instructions and 
thoroughly mixed, making sure neither the mixing container 
nor mixing paddle adds color or effects the hardening of the 
cement. Clean glass or polyethylene mixing containers are 
preferred. Because of their short pot life (approximately 45 
minutes), Cement PS-30® and Weld-On 40® must be used 
quickly once the components are mixed. Time consumed in 
preparation shortens the effective working time, making it 
necessary to have everything ready to be cemented before 
the cements are mixed. For better handling, pour cement 
within 20 minutes of mixing. For maximum joint strength, 
the final cement joint should be free of bubbles. It is usually 
sufficient to allow the mixed cement to stand for 10 minutes 
before cementing to allow bubbles to rise to the surface. The 
gap joint technique can only be used with colorless plexiglas 
acrylic or in cases where joints are hidden. If inconspicuous 
joints in colored plexiglas acrylic are needed, the parts must 
be fitted closely, using closed V-groove, butt, or arc joints.

Cement forms, or dams, may be made with masking tape as 
long as the adhesive surface does not contact the cement. This 
is easily done with a strip of cellophane tape placed over the 
masking tape adhesive. The tape must be chosen carefully. 
The adhesive on ordinary cellophane tape prevents the cure of 
PS-30® and Weld-On 40®. Before actual fabrication of parts, 
sample joints should be tried to ensure that the tape system 
used does not harm the cement. Since it is important for all 
of the cement to remain in the gap, only contact pressure 
should be used.

Bubbles tend to float to the top of the cement bead in a gap joint 
after the cement is poured. These cause no problem if the bead 
is machined off. A small wire (not copper) or similar object 
may be used to lift some bubbles out of the joint; however, the 
cement joint should be disturbed as little as possible.

Polymerizable cements shrink as the cement hardens. 
Therefore, the freshly poured cement bead should be left 
above the surfaces being cemented to compensate for the 
shrinkage. If it is necessary for appearances, the bead may 
be machined off after the cement has set.

AAll the strains that originally caused the crack are concentrated at point      tending to extend the 
crack. Therefore, with a #30 or 1/8"" drill bit, drill a small hole      at the end of the crack point to 
distribute the strain over a wider area.

Each crack occurring at any hole or tear is drilled in the same manner.

Figure 7-93. Stop drilling of cracks.

Repairs
Whenever possible, replace, rather than repair, extensively 
damaged transparent plastic. A carefully patched part is not 
the equal of a new section, either optically or structurally. 
At the first sign of crack development, drill a small hole 
with a #30 or a 1⁄8-inch drill at the extreme ends of the 
cracks. [Figure 7-93] This serves to localize the cracks and 
to prevent further splitting by distributing the strain over a 
large area. If the cracks are small, stopping them with drilled 
holes usually suffices until replacement or more permanent 
repairs can be made. 

Cleaning
Plastics have many advantages over glass for aircraft use, 
but they lack the surface hardness of glass and care must 
be exercised while servicing the aircraft to avoid scratching 
or otherwise damaging the surface. Clean the plastic by 
washing it with plenty of water and mild soap, using a 
clean, soft, grit-free cloth, sponge, or bare hands. Do not use 
gasoline, alcohol, benzene, acetone, carbon tetrachloride, fire 
extinguisher or deicing fluids, lacquer thinners, or window 
cleaning sprays. These soften the plastic and cause crazing.

Plastics should not be rubbed with a dry cloth since it is likely 
to cause scratches and to build up an electrostatic charge that 
attracts dust particles to the surface. If, after removing dirt 
and grease, no great amount of scratching is visible, finish 
the plastic with a good grade of commercial wax. Apply the 
wax in a thin even coat and bring to a high polish by rubbing 
lightly with a soft cloth.

Polishing
Do not attempt hand polishing or buffing until the surface is 
clean. A soft, open-type cotton or flannel buffing wheel is 
suggested. Minor scratches may be removed by vigorously 
rubbing the affected area by hand, using a soft clean cloth 
dampened with a mixture of turpentine and chalk, or by 
applying automobile cleanser with a damp cloth. Remove 
the cleaner and polish with a soft, dry cloth. Acrylic and 

cellulose acetate plastics are thermoplastic. Friction created 
by buffing or polishing too long in one spot can generate 
sufficient heat to soften the surface. This condition produces 
visual distortion and should be avoided.

Windshield Installation
Use material equivalent to that originally used by the 
manufacturer of the aircraft for replacement panels. There 
are many types of transparent plastics on the market. Their 
properties vary greatly, particularly  expansion characteristics, 
brittleness under low temperatures, resistance to discoloration 
when exposed to sunlight, surface checking, etc. Information 
on these properties is in MIL-HDBK-17, Plastics for 
Flight Vehicles, Part II Transparent Glazing Materials, 
available from the Government Printing Office (GPO). 
These properties are considered by aircraft manufacturers 
in selecting materials to be used in their designs and the use 
of substitutes having different characteristics may result in 
subsequent difficulties.

Installation Procedures
When installing a replacement panel, use the same mounting 
method employed by the manufacturer of the aircraft. While 
the actual installation varies from one type of aircraft to 
another, consider the following major principles when 
installing any replacement panel.

1. Never force a plastic panel out of shape to make it fit 
a frame. If a replacement panel does not fit easily into 
the mounting, obtain a new replacement or heat the 
whole panel and re-form. When possible, cut and fit 
a new panel at ordinary room temperature.

2. In clamping or bolting plastic panels into their 
mountings, do not place the plastic under excessive 
compressive stress. It is easy to develop more than 
1,000 psi on the plastic by overtorquing a nut and 
bolt. Tighten each nut to a firm fit, and then back the 
nut off one full turn (until they are snug and can still 
be rotated with the fingers).


7-58

3. In bolted installations, use spacers, collars, shoulders, 
or stop-nuts to prevent tightening the bolt excessively. 
Whenever such devices are used by the aircraft 
manufacturer, retain them in the replacement 
installation. It is important that the original number 
of bolts, complete with washers, spacers, etc., be 
used. When rivets are used, provide adequate spacers 
or other satisfactory means to prevent excessive 
tightening of the frame to the plastic.

4. Mount plastic panels between rubber, cork, or other 
gasket material to make the installation waterproof, to 
reduce vibration, and to help to distribute compressive 
stresses on the plastic.

5. Plastics expand and contract considerably more than 
the metal channels in which they are mounted. Mount 
windshield panels to a sufficient depth in the channel 
to prevent it from falling out when the panel contracts 
at low temperatures or deforms under load. When 
the manufacturer’s original design permits, mount 
panels to a minimum depth of 11⁄8-inches, and with a 
clearance of 1⁄8-inch between the plastic and bottom 
of the channel.

6. In installations involving bolts or rivets, make the 
holes through the plastic oversize by 1⁄8-inch and 
center so that the plastic does not bind or crack at 
the edge of the holes. The use of slotted holes is also 
recommended.

Aircraft Painting and Finishing
Introduction 
Paint, or more specifically its overall color and application, 
is usually the first impression that is transmitted to someone 
when they look at an aircraft for the first time. Paint makes 
a statement about the aircraft and the person who owns or 
operates it. The paint scheme may reflect the owner’s ideas 
and color preferences for an amateur-built aircraft project, 
or it may be colors and identification for the recognition of 
a corporate or air carrier aircraft.


8-2

Paint is more than aesthetics; it affects the weight of the 
aircraft and protects the integrity of the airframe. The 
topcoat finish is applied to protect the exposed surfaces 
from corrosion and deterioration. Also, a properly painted 
aircraft is easier to clean and maintain because the exposed 
surfaces are more resistant to corrosion and dirt, and oil does 
not adhere as readily to the surface.

A wide variety of materials and finishes are used to protect 
and provide the desired appearance of the aircraft. The term 
“paint” is used in a general sense and includes primers, 
enamels, lacquers, and the various multipart finishing 
formulas. Paint has three components: resin as coating 
material, pigment for color, and solvents to reduce the mix 
to a workable viscosity.

Internal structure and unexposed components are finished to 
protect them from corrosion and deterioration. All exposed 
surfaces and components are finished to provide protection 
and to present a pleasing appearance. Decorative finishing 
includes trim striping, the addition of company logos and 
emblems, and the application of decals, identification 
numbers, and letters. 

Finishing Materials 
A wide variety of materials are used in aircraft finishing. 
Some of the more common materials and their uses are 
described in the following paragraphs.

Acetone
Acetone is a fast-evaporating colorless solvent. It is used as 
an ingredient in paint, nail polish, and varnish removers. It 
is a strong solvent for most plastics and is ideal for thinning 
fiberglass resin, polyester resins, vinyl, and adhesives. It is 
also used as a superglue remover. Acetone is a heavy-duty 
degreaser suitable for metal preparation and removing grease 
from fabric covering prior to doping. It should not be used 
as a thinner in dope because of its rapid evaporation, which 
causes the doped area to cool and collect moisture. This 
absorbed moisture prevents uniform drying and results in 
blushing of the dope and a flat no-gloss finish.

Alcohol
Butanol, or butyl alcohol, is a slow-drying solvent that can 
be mixed with aircraft dope to retard drying of the dope film 
on humid days, thus preventing blushing. A mixture of dope 
solvent containing 5 to 10 percent of butyl alcohol is usually 
sufficient for this purpose. Butanol and ethanol alcohol are 
mixed together in ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:3 to use to 
dilute wash coat primer for spray applications because the 
butyl alcohol retards the evaporation rate.

Ethanol or denatured alcohol is used to thin shellac for 
spraying and as a constituent of paint and varnish remover. It 
can also be used as a cleaner and degreaser prior to painting.

Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, can be used as a disinfectant. 
It is used in the formulation of oxygen system cleaning 
solutions. It can be used to remove grease pencil and 
permanent marker from smooth surfaces, or to wipe hand or 
fingerprint oil from a surface before painting. 

Benzene
Benzene is a highly flammable, colorless liquid with a 
sweet odor. It is a product used in some paint and varnish 
removers. It is an industrial solvent that is regulated by 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) because it is 
an extremely toxic chemical compound when inhaled or 
absorbed through the skin. It has been identified as a Class A 
carcinogen known to cause various forms of cancer. It should 
be avoided for use as a common cleaning solvent for paint 
equipment and spray guns.

Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK)
Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), also referred to as 2-Butanone, 
is a highly flammable, liquid solvent used in paint and 
varnish removers, paint and primer thinners, in surface 
coatings, adhesives, printing inks, as a catalyst for polyester 
resin hardening, and as an extraction medium for fats, oils, 
waxes, and resins. Because of its effectiveness as a quickly 
evaporating solvent, MEK is used in formulating high 
solids coatings that help to reduce emissions from coating 
operations. Persons using MEK should use protective gloves 
and have adequate ventilation to avoid the possible irritation 
effects of skin contact and breathing of the vapors.

Methylene Chloride
Methylene chloride is a colorless, volatile liquid completely 
miscible with a variety of other solvents. It is widely used in 
paint strippers and as a cleaning agent/degreaser for metal 
parts. It has no flash point under normal use conditions and 
can be used to reduce the flammability of other substances. 

Toluene
Referred to as toluol or methylbenzene, toluene is a clear, 
water-insoluble liquid with a distinct odor similar to that of 
benzene. It is a common solvent used in paints, paint thinners, 
lacquers, and adhesives. It has been used as a paint remover in 
softening fluorescent-finish, clear-topcoat sealing materials. 
It is also an acceptable thinner for zinc chromate primer. It has 
been used as an antiknocking additive in gasoline. Prolonged 
exposure to toluene vapors should be avoided because it may 
be linked to brain damage.


8-3

Turpentine
Turpentine is obtained by distillation of wood from certain 
pine trees. It is a flammable, water-insoluble liquid solvent 
used as a thinner and quick-drier for varnishes, enamels, and 
other oil-based paints. Turpentine can be used to clean paint 
equipment and paint brushes used with oil-based paints. 

Mineral Spirits
Sometimes referred to as white spirit, Stoddard solvent, or 
petroleum spirits, mineral spirits is a petroleum distillate used 
as a paint thinner and mild solvent. The reference to the name 
Stoddard came from a dry cleaner who helped to develop it 
in the 1920s as a less volatile dry cleaning solvent and as an 
alternative to the more volatile petroleum solvents that were 
being used for cleaning clothes. It is the most widely used 
solvent in the paint industry, used in aerosols, paints, wood 
preservatives, lacquers, and varnishes. It is also commonly 
used to clean paint brushes and paint equipment. Mineral 
spirits are used in industry for cleaning and degreasing 
machine tools and parts because it is very effective in 
removing oils and greases from metal. It has low odor, is 
less flammable, and less toxic than turpentine. 

Naphtha
Naphtha is one of a wide variety of volatile hydrocarbon 
mixtures that is sometimes processed from coal tar but more 
often derived from petroleum. Naphtha is used as a solvent 
for various organic substances, such as fats and rubber, and 
in the making of varnish. It is used as a cleaning fluid and 
is incorporated into some laundry soaps. Naphtha has a 
low flashpoint and is used as a fuel in portable stoves and 
lanterns. It is sold under different names around the world and 
is known as white gas, or Coleman fuel, in North America. 

Linseed Oil
Linseed oil is the most commonly used carrier in oil paint. It 
makes the paint more fluid, transparent, and glossy. It is used 
to reduce semipaste oil colors, such as dull black stenciling 
paint and insignia colors, to a brushing consistency. Linseed 
oil is also used as a protective coating on the interior of metal 
tubing. Linseed oil is derived from pressing the dried ripe 
flax seeds of the flax plant to obtain the oil and then using a 
process called solvent extraction. Oil obtained without the 
solvent extraction process is marketed as flaxseed oil. The 
term “boiled linseed oil” indicates that it was processed with 
additives to shorten its drying time. 

A note of caution is usually added to packaging of linseed 
oil with the statement, “Risk of Fire from Spontaneous 
Combustion Exists with this Product.” Linseed oil generates 
heat as it dries. Oily materials and rags must be properly 
disposed after use to eliminate the possible cause of 
spontaneous ignition and fire.

Thinners
Thinners include a plethora of solvents used to reduce the 
viscosity of any one of the numerous types of primers, 
subcoats, and topcoats. The types of thinner used with the 
various coatings is addressed in other sections of this chapter. 

Varnish
Varnish is a transparent protective finish primarily used 
for finishing wood. It is available in interior and exterior 
grades. The exterior grade does not dry as hard as the 
interior grade, allowing it to expand and contract with the 
temperature changes of the material being finished. Varnish 
is traditionally a combination of a drying oil, a resin, and a 
thinner or solvent. It has little or no color, is transparent, and 
has no added pigment. Varnish dries slower than most other 
finishes. Resin varnishes dry and harden when the solvents 
in them evaporate. Polyurethane and epoxy varnishes remain 
liquid after the evaporation of the solvent but quickly begin to 
cure through chemical reactions of the varnish components.

Primers
The importance of primers in finishing and protection is 
generally misunderstood and underestimated because it is 
invisible after the topcoat finish is applied. A primer is the 
foundation of the finish. Its role is to bond to the surface, inhibit 
corrosion of metal, and provide an anchor point for the finish 
coats. It is important that the primer pigments be either anodic 
to the metal surface or passivate the surface should moisture be 
present. The binder must be compatible with the finish coats. 
Primers on nonmetallic surfaces do not require sacrificial or 
passivating pigments. Some of the various primer types are  
discussed below. 

Wash Primers
Wash primers are water-thin coatings of phosphoric acid in 
solutions of vinyl butyral resin, alcohol, and other ingredients. 
They are very low in solids with almost no filling qualities. 
Their functions are to passivate the surface, temporarily 
provide corrosion resistance, and provide an adhesive base 
for the next coating, such as a urethane or epoxy primer. 
Wash primers do not require sanding and have high-corrosion 
protection qualities. Some have a very small recoat time 
frame that must be considered when painting larger aircraft. 
The manufacturers’ instructions must be followed for 
satisfactory results.  

Red Iron Oxide
Red oxide primer is an alkyd resin-based coating that 
was developed for use over iron and steel located in mild 
environmental conditions. It can be applied over rust that is 
free of loose particles, oil, and grease. It has limited use in 
the aviation industry. 


8-4

Gray Enamel Undercoat
This is a single component, nonsanding primer compatible 
with a wide variety of topcoats. It fills minor imperfections, 
dries fast without shrinkage, and has high-corrosion 
resistance. It is a good primer for composite substrates.

Urethane 
This is a term that is misused or interchanged by painters 
and manufacturers alike. It is typically a two-part product 
that uses a chemical activator to cure by linking molecules 
together to form a whole new compound. Polyurethane is 
commonly used when referring to urethane, but not when 
the product being referred to is acrylic urethane. 

Urethane primer, like the urethane paint, is also a two-part 
product that uses a chemical activator to cure. It is easy 
to sand and fills well. The proper film thickness must be 
observed, because it can shrink when applied too heavily. It is 
typically applied over a wash primer for best results. Special 
precautions must be taken by persons spraying because 
the activators contain isocyanates (discussed further in the 
Protective Equipment section at the end of this chapter).

Epoxy
Epoxy is a synthetic, thermosetting resin that produces 
tough, hard, chemical-resistant coatings and adhesives. It 
uses a catalyst to chemically activate the product, but it is not 
classified as hazardous because it contains no isocyanates. 
Epoxy can be used as a nonsanding primer/sealer over bare 
metal and it is softer than urethane, so it has good chip 
resistance. It is recommended for use on steel tube frame 
aircraft prior to installing fabric covering. 

Zinc Chromate
Zinc chromate is a corrosion-resistant pigment that can 
be added to primers made of different resin types, such as 
epoxy, polyurethane, and alkyd. Older type zinc chromate 
is distinguishable by its bright yellow color when compared 
to the light green color of some of the current brand primers. 
Moisture in the air causes the zinc chromate to react with 
the metal surface, and it forms a passive layer that prevents 
corrosion. Zinc chromate primer was, at one time, the 
standard primer for aircraft painting. Environmental concerns 
and new formula primers have all but replaced it. 

Identification of Paints
Dope
When fabric-covered aircraft ruled the sky, dope was the 
standard finish used to protect and color the fabric. The dope 
imparted additional qualities of increased tensile strength, 
airtightness, weather-proofing, ultraviolet (UV) protection, 
and tautness to the fabric cover. Aircraft dope is essentially 

a colloidal solution of cellulose acetate or nitrate combined 
with plasticizers to produce a smooth, flexible, homogeneous 
film. 

Dope is still used on fabric covered aircraft as part of a 
covering process. However, the type of fabric being used 
to cover the aircraft has changed. Grade A cotton or linen 
was the standard covering used for years, and it still may 
be used if it meets the requirements of the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA), Technical Standard Order (TSO) 
C-15d/AMS 3806c. 

Polyester fabric coverings now dominate in the aviation 
industry. These new fabrics have been specifically 
developed for aircraft and are far superior to cotton and 
linen. The protective coating and topcoat finishes used 
with the Ceconite® polyester fabric covering materials are 
part of a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) and must 
be used as specified when covering any aircraft with a 
Standard Airworthiness Certificate. The Ceconite® covering 
procedures use specific brand name, nontautening nitrate and 
butyrate dope as part of the STC.
 
The Poly-Fiber® system also uses a special polyester fabric 
covering as part of its STC, but it does not use dope. All the 
liquid products in the Poly-Fiber® system are made from 
vinyl, not from cellulose dope. The vinyl coatings have 
several real advantages over dope: they remain flexible, they 
do not shrink, they do not support combustion, and they are 
easily removed from the fabric with MEK, which simplifies 
most repairs. 
 
Synthetic Enamel
Synthetic enamel is an oil-based, single-stage paint (no clear 
coat) that provides durability and protection. It can be mixed 
with a hardener to increase the durability and shine while 
decreasing the drying time. It is one of the more economical 
types of finish.

Lacquers
The origin of lacquer dates back thousands of years to a resin 
obtained from trees indigenous to China. In the early 1920s, 
nitrocellulose lacquer was developed from a process using 
cotton and wood pulp. 

Nitrocellulose lacquers produce a hard, semiflexible finish 
that can be polished to a high sheen. The clear variety yellows 
as it ages, and it can shrink over time to a point that the surface 
crazes. It is easy to spot repair because each new coat of 
lacquer softens and blends into the previous coat. This was 
one of the first coatings used by the automotive industry in 
mass production, because it reduced finishing times from 
almost two weeks to two days. 


8-5

Acrylic lacquers were developed to eliminate the yellowing 
problems and crazing of the nitrocellulose lacquers. General 
Motors started using acrylic lacquer in the mid-1950s, and 
they used it into the 1960s on some of their premium model 
cars. Acrylics have the same working properties but dry to a 
less brittle and more flexible film than nitrocellulose lacquer. 

Lacquer is one of the easiest paints to spray, because it dries 
quickly and can be applied in thin coats. However, lacquer 
is not very durable; bird droppings, acid rain, and gasoline 
spills actually eat down into the paint. It still has limited use 
on collector and show automobiles because they are usually 
kept in a garage, protected from the environment. 

The current use of lacquer for an exterior coating on an 
aircraft is almost nonexistent because of durability and 
environmental concerns. Upwards of 85 percent of the 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the spray gun ends 
up in the atmosphere, and some states have banned its use. 

There are some newly developed lacquers that use a catalyst, 
but they are used mostly in the woodworking and furniture 
industry. They have the ease of application of nitrocellulose 
lacquer with much better water, chemical, and abrasion 
resistance. Additionally, catalyzed lacquers cure chemically, 
not solely through the evaporation of solvents, so there is 
a reduction of VOCs released into the atmosphere. It is 
activated when the catalyst is added to the base mixture. 

Polyurethane
Polyurethane is at the top of the list when compared to 
other coatings for abrasion-, stain-, and chemical-resistant 
properties. Polyurethane was the coating that introduced 
the wet look. It has a high degree of natural resistance to the 
damaging effects of UV rays from the sun. Polyurethane is 
usually the first choice for coating and finishing the corporate 
and commercial aircraft in today’s aviation environment.

Urethane Coating
The term urethane applies to certain types of binders used 
for paints and clear coatings. (A binder is the component that 
holds the pigment together in a tough, continuous film and 
provides film integrity and adhesion.) Typically, urethane is 
a two-part coating that consists of a base and catalyst that, 
when mixed, produces a durable, high-gloss finish that is 
abrasion- and chemical-resistant. 

Acrylic Urethanes
Acrylic simply means plastic. It dries to a harder surface but 
is not as resistant to harsh chemicals as polyurethane. Most 
acrylic urethanes need additional UV inhibitors added when 
subject to the UV rays of the sun.   

Methods of Applying Finish
There are several methods of applying aircraft finish. Among 
the most common are dipping, brushing, and spraying.

Dipping
The application of finishes by dipping is generally confined 
to factories or large repair stations. The process consists of 
dipping the part to be finished in a tank filled with the finishing 
material. Primer coats are frequently applied in this manner.

Brushing
Brushing has long been a satisfactory method of applying 
finishes to all types of surfaces. Brushing is generally used for 
small repair work and on surfaces where it is not practicable 
to spray paint. 

The material to be applied should be thinned to the proper 
consistency for brushing. A material that is too thick has a 
tendency to pull or rope under the brush. If the materials 
are too thin, they are likely to run or not cover the surface 
adequately. Proper thinning and substrate temperature allows 
the finish to flow-out and eliminates the brush marks.

Spraying
Spraying is the preferred method for a quality finish. 
Spraying is used to cover large surfaces with a uniform 
layer of material, which results in the most cost effective 
method of application. All spray systems have several basic 
similarities. There must be an adequate source of compressed 
air, a reservoir or feed tank to hold a supply of the finishing 
material, and a device for controlling the combination of the 
air and finishing material ejected in an atomized cloud or 
spray against the surface to be coated.

A self-contained, pressurized spray can of paint meets the 
above requirements and satisfactory results can be obtained 
painting components and small areas of touchup. However, 
the aviation coating materials available in cans is limited, and 
this chapter addresses the application of mixed components 
through a spray gun. 

There are two main types of spray equipment. A spray gun 
with an integral paint container is adequate for use when 
painting small areas. When large areas are painted, pressure-
feed equipment is more desirable since a large supply of 
finishing material can be applied without the interruption 
of having to stop and refill a paint container. An added 
bonus is the lighter overall weight of the spray gun and 
the flexibility of spraying in any direction with a constant 
pressure to the gun.


8-6

Figure 8-1. Standard air compressor.

The air supply to the spray gun must be entirely free of water 
or oil in order to produce the optimum results in the finished 
product. Water traps, as well as suitable filters to remove any 
trace of oil, must be incorporated in the air pressure supply 
line. These filters and traps must be serviced on a regular basis.

Finishing Equipment
Paint Booth
A paint booth may be a small room in which components 
of an aircraft are painted, or it can be an aircraft hangar big 
enough to house the largest aircraft. Whichever it is, the 
location must be able to protect the components or aircraft 
from the elements. Ideally, it would have temperature and 
humidity controls; but, in all cases, the booth or hangar must 
have good lighting, proper ventilation, and be dust free. 

A simple paint booth can be constructed for a small aircraft 
by making a frame out of wood or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 
pipe. It needs to be large enough to allow room to walk around 
and maneuver the spray gun. The top and sides can be covered 
with plastic sheeting stapled or taped to the frame. An exhaust 
fan can be added to one end with a large air-conditioning 
filter placed on the opposite end to filter incoming air. Lights 
should be large enough to be set up outside of the spray booth 
and shine through the sheeting or plastic windows. The ideal 
amount of light would be enough to produce a glare off of 
all the surfaces to be sprayed. This type of temporary booth 
can be set up in a hangar, a garage, or outside on a ramp, if 
the weather and temperature are favorable.

Normally, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
regulations do not apply to a person painting one airplane. 
However, anyone planning to paint an aircraft should be 
aware that local clean air regulations may be applicable to an 
airplane painting project. When planning to paint an aircraft 
at an airport, it would be a good idea to check with the local 
airport authority before starting. 

Air Supply
The air supply for paint spraying using a conventional siphon 
feed spray gun should come from an air compressor with a 
storage tank big enough to provide an uninterrupted supply 
of air with at least 90 pounds per square inch (psi) providing 
10 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air to the spray gun. 

The compressor needs to be equipped with a regulator, water 
trap, air hose, and an adequate filter system to ensure that 
clean, dry, oil-free air is delivered to the spray gun. 
 
If using one of the newer high-volume low-pressure (HVLP) 
spray guns and using a conventional compressor, it is better 
to use a two stage compressor of at least a 5 horsepower (hp) 

that operates at 90 psi and provides 20 CFM to the gun. The 
key to the operation of the newer HVLP spray guns is the 
air volume, not the pressure. 

If purchasing a new complete HVLP system, the air supply 
is from a turbine compressor. An HVLP turbine has a series 
of fans, or stages, that move a lot of air at low pressure. 
The more stages provide greater air output (rated in CFM) 
that means better atomization of the coating being sprayed. 
The intake air is also the cooling air for the motor. This air 
is filtered from dirt and dust particles prior to entering the 
turbine. Some turbines also have a second filter for the air 
supply to the spray gun. The turbine does not produce oil 
or water to contaminate the air supply, but the air supply 
from the turbine heats up, causing the paint to dry faster, so 
you may need an additional length of hose to reduce the air 
temperature at the spray gun. 

Spray Equipment
Air Compressors
Piston–type compressors are available with one-stage and 
multiple-stage compressors, various size motors, and various 
size supply tanks. The main requirement for painting is to 
ensure the spray gun has a continuous supplied volume of 
air. Piston-type compressors compress air and deliver it to 
a storage tank. Most compressors provide over 100 psi, but 
only the larger ones provide the volume of air needed for an 
uninterrupted supply to the gun. The multistage compressor 
is a good choice for a shop when a large volume of air is 
needed for pneumatic tools. When in doubt about the size of 
the compressor, compare the manufacturer’s specifications 
and get the largest one possible. [Figure 8-1]


8-7

Figure 8-2. Pressure paint tank.

Figure 8-3. Air line filter assembly.

Large Coating Containers
For large painting projects, such as spraying an entire aircraft, 
the quantity of mixed paint in a pressure tank provides many 
advantages. The setup allows a greater area to be covered 
without having to stop and fill the cup on a spray gun. The 
painter is able to keep a wet paint line, and more material 
is applied to the surface with less overspray. It provides the 
flexibility of maneuvering the spray gun in any position 
without the restriction and weight of an attached paint cup. 
Remote pressure tanks are available in sizes from 2 quarts 
to over 60 gallons. [Figure 8-2]

System Air Filters
The use of a piston-type air compressor for painting requires 
that the air supply lines include filters to remove water and 
oil. A typical filter assembly is shown in Figure 8-3.

Miscellaneous Painting Tools and Equipment
Some tools that are available to the painter include: 

• Masking paper/tape dispenser that accommodates 
various widths of masking paper. It includes a masking 
tape dispenser that applies the tape to one edge of the 
paper as it is rolled off to facilitate one person applying 
the paper and tape in a single step.

• Electronic and magnetic paint thickness gauges to 
measure dry paint thickness.

• Wet film gauges to measure freshly applied wet paint. 

• Infrared thermometers to measure coating and 
substrate surfaces to verify that they fall in the 
recommended temperature range prior to spraying. 

Spray Guns
A top quality spray gun is a key component in producing a 
quality finish in any coating process. It is especially important 
when painting an aircraft because of the large area and varied 
surfaces that must be sprayed. 

When spray painting, it is of utmost importance to follow 
the manufacturer’s recommendations for correct sizing of 
the air cap, fluid tip, and needle combinations. The right 
combination provides the best coverage and the highest 
quality finish in the shortest amount of time.

All of the following examples of the various spray guns 
(except the airless) are of the air atomizing type. They are the 
most capable of providing the highest quality finish. 

Siphon-Feed Gun

The siphon-feed gun is a conventional spray gun familiar to 
most people, with a one quart paint cup located below the gun. 
Regulated air passes through the gun and draws (siphons) 
the paint from the supply cup. This is an external mix gun, 
which means the air and fluid mix outside the air cap. This 
gun applies virtually any type coating and provides a high 
quality finish. [Figure 8-4]

Gravity-Feed Gun

A gravity-feed gun provides the same high-quality finish as 
a siphon-feed gun, but the paint supply is located in a cup 
on top of the gun and supplied by gravity. The operator can 
make fine adjustments between the atomizing pressure and 
fluid flow and utilize all material in the cup. This also is an 
external mix gun. [Figure 8-5]

The HVLP production spray gun is an internal mix gun. The 
air and fluid is mixed inside the air cap. Because of the low 
pressure used in the paint application, it transfers at least 65

percent and upwards of 80 percent of the finish material to 
the surface. HVLP spray guns are available with a standard 
cup located underneath or in a gravity-feed model with the 
cup on top. The sample shown can be connected with hoses 
to a remote paint material container holding from 2 quarts 
to 60 gallons. [Figure 8-6]

Because of more restrictive EPA regulations, and the fact that 
more paint is being transferred to the surface with less waste 
from overspray, a large segment of the paint and coating 
industry is switching to HVLP spray equipment. 

Airless spraying does not directly use compressed air to 
atomize the coating material. A pump delivers paint to the 
spray gun under high hydraulic pressure (500 to 4,500 psi) to 
atomize the fluid. The fluid is then released through an orifice 
in the spray nozzle. This system increases transfer efficiency 
and production speed with less overspray than conventional 
air atomized spray systems. It is used for production work 
but does not provide the fine finish of air atomized systems.

Fresh Air Breathing Systems
Fresh air breathing systems should be used whenever coatings 
are being sprayed that contain isocyanides. This includes 
all polyurethane coatings. The system incorporates a high-
capacity electric air turbine that provides a constant source of 
fresh air to the mask. The use of fresh air breathing systems 
is also highly recommended when spraying chromate primers 
and chemical stripping aircraft. The system provides cool 
filtered breathing air with up to 200 feet of hose, which allows 
the air pump intake to be placed in an area of fresh air, well 
outside of the spraying area. [Figure 8-8]

A charcoal-filtered respirator should be used for all other 
spraying and sanding operations to protect the lungs and 
respiratory tract. The respirator should be a double-cartridge, 
organic vapor type that provides a tight seal around the nose 
and mouth. The cartridges can be changed separately, and 
should be changed when detecting odor or experiencing nose 
or throat irritation. The outer prefilters should be changed if 
experiencing increased resistance to breathing. [Figure 8-9] 

Viscosity Measuring Cup
This is a small cup with a long handle and a calibrated orifice 
in the bottom that allows the liquid in the cup to drain out 
at a specific timed rate. Coating manufacturers recommend 
spraying their product at a specific pressure and viscosity. 
That viscosity is determined by measuring the efflux (drain) 
time of the liquid coating through the cup orifice. The time 
(in seconds) is listed on most paint manufacturers’ product/
technical data pages. The measurement determines if the 
mixed coating meets the recommended viscosity for spraying. 

There are different manufacturers of the viscosity measuring 
devices, but the most common one listed and used for spray 
painting is known as a Zahn cup. The orifice number must 
correspond to the one listed on the product/technical data 
sheet. For most primers and topcoats, the #2 or #3 Zahn cup 
is the one recommended. [Figure 8-10]

To perform an accurate viscosity measurement, it is very 
important that the temperature of the sample material be 
within the recommended range of 73.5 °F ± 3.5 °F (23 ºC ± 
2 ºC), and then proceed as follows: 

1. Thoroughly mix the sample with minimum bubbles.

2. Dip the Zahn cup vertically into the sample being 
tested, totally immersing the cup below the surface.

3. With a stopwatch in one hand, briskly lift the cup out 
of the sample. As the top edge of the cup breaks the 
surface, start the stopwatch.

4. Stop the stopwatch when the first break in the flow of 
the liquid is observed at the orifice exit. The number 
in seconds is referred to as the efflux time.

5. Record the time on the stopwatch and compare it to 
the coating manufacturer’s recommendation. Adjust 
the viscosity, if necessary, but be aware not to thin 
the coating below recommendations that could result 
in the release of VOCs into the atmosphere above the 
regulated limitations.

Mixing Equipment
Use a paint shaker for all coatings within 5 days of 
application to ensure the material is thoroughly mixed. Use 
a mechanical paint stirrer to mix larger quantities of material. 
If a mechanical stirrer is driven by a drill, the drill should be 
pneumatic, instead of electric. The sparks from an electric 
drill can cause an explosion from the paint vapors. 

Preparation 
Surfaces
The most important part of any painting project is the 
preparation of the substrate surface. It takes the most work 
and time, but with the surface properly prepared, the results 
are a long-lasting, corrosion-free finish. Repainting an older 
aircraft requires more preparation time than a new paint job 
because of the additional steps required to strip the old paint, 
and then clean the surface and crevices of paint remover. 
Paint stripping is discussed in another section of this chapter. 

It is recommended that all the following procedures be 
performed using protective clothing, rubber gloves, and 
goggles, in a well-ventilated area, at temperatures between 
68 °F and 100 °F. 

Aluminum surfaces are the most common on a typical 
aircraft. The surface should be scrubbed with Scotch-Brite® 
pads using an alkaline aviation cleaner. The work area should 
be kept wet and rinsed with clean water until the surface is 
water break free. This means that there are no beads or breaks 
in the water surface as it flows over the aluminum surface.

The next step is to apply an acid etch solution to the surface. 
Following manufacturers’ suggestions, this is applied like a 
wash using a new sponge and covering a small area while 
keeping it wet and allowing it to contact the surface for between 
1 and 2 minutes. It is then rinsed with clean water without 
allowing the solution to dry on the surface. Continue this 
process until all the aluminum surfaces are washed and rinsed. 
Extra care must be taken to thoroughly rinse this solution from 
all the hidden areas that it may penetrate. It provides a source 
for corrosion to form if not completely removed.

When the surfaces are completely dry from the previous 
process, the next step is to apply Alodine® or another type of 
an aluminum conversion coating. This coating is also applied 
like a wash, allowing the coating to contact the surface and 
keeping it wet for 2 to 5 minutes without letting it dry. It 
then must be thoroughly rinsed with clean water to remove 
all chemical salts from the surface. Depending on the brand, 
the conversion coating may color the aluminum a light gold 
or green, but some brands are colorless. When the surface 
is thoroughly dry, the primer should be applied as soon as 
possible as recommended by the manufacturer.

The primer should be one that is compatible with the topcoat 
finish. Two-part epoxy primers provide excellent corrosion 
resistance and adhesion for most epoxy and urethane surfaces 
and polyurethane topcoats. Zinc chromate should not be used 
under polyurethane paints. 

Composite surfaces that need to be primed may include the 
entire aircraft if it is constructed from those materials, or they 
may only be components of the aircraft, such as fairings, 
radomes, antennas, and the tips of the control surfaces. 

Epoxy sanding primers have been developed that provide 
an excellent base over composites and can be finish 
sanded with 320 grit using a dual action orbital sander. 
They are compatible with two-part epoxy primers and  
polyurethane topcoats.

Topcoats must be applied over primers within the 
recommended time window, or the primer may have to be 
scuff sanded before the finish coat is applied. Always follow 
the recommendations of the coating manufacturer. 

Primer and Paint
Purchase aircraft paint for the aviation painting project. 
Paint manufacturers use different formulas for aircraft and 
automobiles because of the environments they operate in. The 
aviation coatings are formulated to have more flexibility and 
chemical resistance than the automotive paint. 

It is also highly recommended that compatible paints of the 
same brand are used for the entire project. The complete 
system (of a particular brand) from etching to primers and 
reducers to the finish topcoat are formulated to work together. 
Mixing brands is a risk that may ruin the entire project. 

When purchasing the coatings for a project, always request 
a manufacturer’s technical or material data and safety data 
sheets, for each component used. Before starting to spray, 
read the sheets. If the manufacturer’s recommendations are 
not followed, a less than satisfactory finish or a hazard to 
personal safety or the environment may result. It cannot 
be emphasized enough to follow the manufacturer’s 
recommendations. The finished result is well worth the effort.
 
Before primer or paint is used for any type application, it must 
be thoroughly mixed. This is done so that any pigment that 
may have settled to the bottom of the container is brought 
into suspension and distributed evenly throughout the paint. 
Coatings now have shelf lives listed in their specification 
sheets. If a previously opened container is found to have a 
skin or film formed over the primer or paint, the film must 
be completely removed before mixing. The material should

not be used if it has exceeded its shelf life and/or has become 
thick or jelled. 

Mechanical shaking is recommended for all coatings within 
5  days of use. After opening, a test with a hand stirrer should 
be made to ensure that all the pigment has been brought into 
suspension. Mechanical stirring is recommended for all two-
part coatings. When mixing any two-part paint, the catalyst/
activator should always be added to the base or pigmented 
component. The technical or material data sheet of the coating 
manufacturer should be followed for recommended times of 
induction (the time necessary for the catalyst to react with 
the base prior to application). Some coatings do not require 
any induction time after mixing, and others need 30 minutes 
of reaction time before being applied. 

Thinning of the coating material should follow the 
recommendations of the manufacturer. The degree of 
thinning depends on the method of application. For spray 
application, the type of equipment, air pressure, and 
atmospheric conditions guide the selection and mixing 
ratios for the thinners. Because of the importance of accurate 
thinning to the finished product, use a viscosity measuring 
(flow) cup. Material thinned using this method is the correct 
viscosity for the best application results.

Thin all coating materials and mix in containers separate from 
the paint cup or pot. Then, filter the material through a paint 
strainer recommended for the type coating you are spraying 
as you pour it into the cup or supply pot.

Spray Gun Operation
Adjusting the Spray Pattern
To obtain the correct spray pattern, set the recommended air 
pressure on the gun, usually 40 to 50 psi for a conventional 
gun. Test the pattern of the gun by spraying a piece of 
masking paper taped to the wall. Hold the gun square to the 
wall approximately 8 to 10 inches from the surface. (With 
hand spread, it is the distance from the tip of the thumb to 
the tip of the little finger.) 

All spray guns (regardless of brand name) have the same type 
of adjustments. The upper control knob proportions the air 
flow, adjusting the spray pattern of the gun. [Figure 8-11] 
The lower knob adjusts the fluid passing the needle, which in 
turn controls the amount or volume of paint being delivered 
through the gun.

Pull the trigger lever fully back. Move the gun across the 
paper, and alternately adjust between the two knobs to obtain 
a spray fan of paint that is wet from top to bottom (somewhat 
like the pattern at dial 10.) Turning in (to the right) on the 
lower, or fluid knob, reduces the amount of paint going 
through the gun. Turning out increases the volume of paint. 
Turning out (to the left) on the upper, or pattern control knob, 
widens the spray pattern. Turning in reduces it to a cone shape 
(as shown with dial set at 0).

Once the pattern is set on the gun, the next step is to follow 
the correct spraying technique for applying the coating to 
the surface. 

Applying the Finish
If the painter has never used a spray gun to apply a finish 
coat of paint, and the aircraft has been completely prepared, 
cleaned, primed, and ready for the topcoat, he or she may need 
to pause for some practice. Reading a book or an instruction 
manual is a good start as it provides the basic knowledge 
about the movement of the spray gun across the surface. 
Also, if available, the opportunity to observe an aircraft being 
painted is well worth the time. 

At this point in the project, the aircraft has already received 
its primer coats. The difference between the primer and the 
finish topcoat is that the primer is flat (no gloss) and the 
finish coat has a glossy surface (some more than others, 
depending on the paint). The flat finish of the primer is 
obtained by paying attention to the basics of trigger control 
distance from the surface and consistent speed of movement 
of the spray gun across the surface.

Arcing causes uneven application

Figure 8-12. Proper spray application.

Primer is typically applied using a crosscoat spray pattern. A 
crosscoat is one pass of the gun from left to right, followed 
by another pass moving up and down. The starting direction 
does not matter as long as the spraying is accomplished in 
two perpendicular passes. The primer should be applied in 
light coats as cross-coating is the application of two coats 
of primer. 

Primer does not tend to run because it is applied in light 
coats. The gloss finish requires a little more experience 
with the gun. A wetter application produces the gloss, but 
the movement of the gun, overlap of the spray pattern, and 
the distance from the surface all affect the final product. It is 
very easy to vary one or another, yielding runs or dry spots 
and a less than desirable finish. Practice not only provides 
some experience, but also provides the confidence needed 
to produce the desired finish. 

Start the practice by spraying the finish coat material on a flat, 
horizontal panel. The spray pattern has been already adjusted 
by testing it on the masking paper taped to the wall. Hold the 
gun 8–10 inches away from and perpendicular to the surface. 
Pull the trigger enough for air to pass through the cap and start 
a pass with the gun moving across the panel. As it reaches 
the point to start painting, squeeze the trigger fully back and 
continue moving the gun about one foot per second across the 
panel until the end is reached. Then, release the trigger enough 
to stop the paint flow but not the air flow. [Figure 8-12]

The constant air flow through the gun maintains a constant 
pressure, rather than a buildup of pressure each time that the 

trigger is released. This would cause a buildup of paint at the 
end of each pass, causing runs and sags in the finish. Repeat 
the sequence of the application, moving back in the opposite 
direction and overlapping the first pass by 50 percent. This 
is accomplished by aiming the center of the spray pattern at 
the outer edge of the first pass and continuing the overlap 
with each successive pass of the gun. 

Once the painter has mastered spraying a flat horizontal panel, 
practice next on a panel that is positioned vertically against a 
wall. This is the panel that shows the value of applying a light 
tack coat before spraying on the second coat. The tack coat 
holds the second coat from sagging and runs. Practice spraying 
this test panel both horizontally with overlapping passes and 
then rotate the air cap 90° on the gun and practice spraying 
vertically with the same 50 percent overlapping passes.
 
Practice cross-coating the paint for an even application. 
Apply two light spray passes horizontally, overlapping each 
by 50 percent, and allowing it to tack. Then, spray vertically 
with overlapping passes, covering the horizontal sprayed 
area. When practice results in a smooth, glossy, no-run 
application on the vertical test panel, you are ready to try 
your skill on the actual project.

Common Spray Gun Problems
A quick check of the spray pattern can be verified before 
using the gun by spraying some thinner or reducer, 
compatible with the finish used, through the gun. It is not of 
the same viscosity as the coating, but it indicates if the gun 
is working properly before the project is started. 


8-13

Figure 8-13. Example of poor adhesion. 

If the gun is not working properly, use the following 
information to troubleshoot the problem: 

• A pulsating, or spitting, fan pattern may be caused by 
a loose nozzle, clogged vent hole on the supply cup, 
or the packing may be leaking around the needle.

• If the spray pattern is offset to one side or the other, 
the air ports in the air cap or the ports in the horns may 
be plugged.

• If the spray pattern is heavy on the top or the bottom, 
rotate the air cap 180°. If the pattern reverses, the air 
cap is the problem. If it stays the same, the fluid tip 
or needle may be damaged.

• Other spray pattern problems may be a result of 
improper air pressure, improper reducing of the 
material, or wrong size spray nozzle. 

Sequence for Painting a Single-Engine or 
Light Twin Airplane
As a general practice on any surface being painted, spray each 
application of coating in a different direction to facilitate even 
and complete coverage. After you apply the primer, apply 
the tack coat and subsequent top coats in opposite directions, 
one coat vertically and the next horizontally, as appropriate. 

Start by spraying all the corners and gaps between the control 
surfaces and fixed surfaces. Paint the leading and trailing 
edges of all surfaces. Spray the landing gear and wheel wells, 
if applicable, and paint the bottom of the fuselage up the sides 
to a horizontal break, such as a seam line. Paint the underside 
of the horizontal stabilizer. Paint the vertical stabilizer and the 
rudder, and then move to the top of the horizontal stabilizer. 
Spray the top and sides of the fuselage down to the point 
of the break from spraying the underside of the fuselage. 
Then, spray the underside of the wings. Complete the job 
by spraying the top of the wings.

The biggest challenge is to control the overspray and keep the 
paint line wet. The ideal scenario would be to have another 
experienced painter with a second spray gun help with the 
painting. It is much easier to keep the paint wet and the job 
is completed in half the time. 
 
Common Paint Troubles
Common problems that may occur during the painting 
of almost any project but are particularly noticeable and 
troublesome on the surfaces of an aircraft include poor 
adhesion, blushing, pinholes, sags and/or runs, “orange peel,” 
fisheyes, sanding scratches, wrinkling, and spray dust. 

Poor Adhesion

• Improper cleaning and preparation of the surface to 
be finished.

• Application of the wrong primer.

• Incompatibility of the topcoat with the primer. 
[Figure 8-13]

• Improper thinning of the coating material or selection 
of the wrong grade reducer.

• Improper mixing of materials. 

• Contamination of the spray equipment and/or air 
supply.

Correction for poor adhesion requires a complete removal of 
the finish, a determination and correction of the cause, and a 
complete refinishing of the affected area.

Blushing
Blushing is the dull milky haze that appears in a paint finish. 
[Figure 8-14] It occurs when moisture is trapped in the paint. 
Blushing forms when the solvents quickly evaporate from the 
sprayed coating, causing a drop in temperature that is enough 
to condense the water in the air. It usually forms when the 
humidity is above 80 percent. Other causes include:

• Incorrect temperature (below 60 °F or above 95 °F). 

• Incorrect reducer (fast drying) being used.

• Excessively high air pressure at the spray gun.

If blushing is noticed during painting, a slow-drying reducer 
can sometimes be added to the paint mixture, and then the 
area resprayed. If blushing is found after the finish has dried, 
the area must be sanded down and repainted. 


8-14

Figure 8-14. Example of blushing. Figure 8-16. Example of sags and runs. 

Figure 8-15. Example of pinholes. Figure 8-17. Example of orange peel.

Pinholes
Pinholes are tiny holes, or groups of holes, that appear in the 
surface of the finish as a result of trapped solvents, air, or 
moisture. [Figure 8-15] Examples include: 

• Contaminants in the paint or air lines. 

• Poor spraying techniques that allow excessively heavy 
or wet paint coats, which tend to trap moisture or 
solvent under the finish. 

• Use of the wrong thinner or reducer, either too fast by 
quick drying the surface and trapping solvents or too 
slow and trapping solvents by subsequent topcoats. 

If pinholes occur during painting, the equipment and painting 
technique must be evaluated before continuing. When dry, 
sand the surface smooth and then repaint. 

Sags and Runs
Sags and runs are usually caused by applying too much paint 
to an area, by holding the spray gun too close to the surface, or 
moving the gun too slowly across the surface. [Figure 8-16] 

Other causes include:

• Too much reducer in the paint (too thin).

• Incorrect spray gun setting of air-paint mixture. 

Sags and runs can be avoided by following the recommended 
thinning instructions for the coatings being applied and taking 
care to use the proper spray gun techniques, especially on 
vertical surfaces and projected edges. Dried sags and runs 
must be sanded out and the surface repainted.

Orange Peel
“Orange peel” refers to the appearance of a bumpy surface, 
much like the skin of an orange. [Figure 8-17] It can be the 
result of a number of factors with the first being the improper 
adjustment of the spray gun. Other causes include:

• Not enough reducer (too thick) or the wrong type 
reducer for the ambient temperature.

• Material not uniformly mixed. 


8-15

Figure 8-18. Example of fisheyes. 

Figure 8-19. Example of sanding scratches.

Figure 8-20. Example of wrinkling.

• Forced drying method, either with fans or heat, is too 
quick.

• Too little flash time between coats.

• Spray painting when the ambient or substrate 
temperature is either too hot or too cold.

Light orange peel can be wet sanded or buffed out with 
polishing compound. In extreme cases, it has to be sanded 
smooth and resprayed.

Fisheyes
Fisheyes appear as small holes in the coating as it is being 
applied, which allows the underlying surface to be seen. 
[Figure 8-18] Usually, it is due to the surface not being 
cleaned of all traces of silicone wax. If numerous fisheyes 
appear when spraying a surface, stop spraying and clean 
off all the wet paint. Then, thoroughly clean the surface to 
remove all traces of silicone with a silicone wax remover. 

The most effective way to eliminate fisheyes is to ensure 
that the surface about to be painted is clean and free from 
any type of contamination. A simple and effective way to 
check this is referred to as a water break test. Using clean 
water, spray, pour, or gently hose down the surface to be 
painted. If the water beads up anywhere on the surface, it is 
not clean. The water should flatten out and cover the area 
with an unbroken film. 

If the occasional fisheye appears when spraying, wait until 
the first coat sets up and then add a recommended amount of 
fisheye eliminator to the subsequent finish coats. Fisheyes may 
appear during touchup of a repair. A coat of sealer may help, 
but completed removal of the finish may be the only solution. 

One last check before spraying is to ensure that the air 
compressor has been drained of water, the regulator cleaned, 
and the system filters are clean or have been replaced so that 
this source of contamination is eliminated. 

Sanding Scratches
Sanding scratches appear in the finish paint when the surface 
has not been properly sanded and/or sealed prior to spraying 
the finish coats. [Figure 8-19] This usually shows up in 
nonmetal surfaces. Composite cowling, wood surfaces, and 
plastic fairings must be properly sanded and sealed before 
painting. The scratches may also appear if on overly rapid 
quick-drying thinner is used.

The only fix after the finish coat has set up is to sand down 
the affected areas using a finer grade of sandpaper, follow 
with a recommended sealer, and then repaint. 

Wrinkling
Wrinkling is usually caused by trapped solvents and unequal 
drying of the paint finish due to excessively thick or solvent-
heavy paint coats. [Figure 8-20] Fast reducers can also 
contribute to wrinkling if the sprayed coat is not allowed to 
dry thoroughly. Thick coatings and quick-drying reducers 


8-16

Figure 8-21. Example of spray dust.

allow the top surface of the coating to dry, trapping the 
solvents underneath. If another heavy coat is applied before 
the first one dries, wrinkles may result. It may also have the 
effect of lifting the coating underneath, almost with the same 
result as a paint stripper. 

Rapid changes in ambient temperatures while spraying may 
cause an uneven release of the solvents, causing the surface 
to dry, shrink, and wrinkle. Making the mistake of using an 
incompatible thinner, or reducer, when mixing the coating 
materials may cause not only wrinkles but other problems 
as well. Wrinkled paint must be completely removed and 
the surface refinished. 

Spray Dust
Spray dust is caused by the atomized spray particles from the 
gun becoming dry before reaching the surface being painted, 
thus failing to flow into a continuous film. [Figure 8-21] This 
may be caused by:

• Incorrect spray gun setting of air pressure, paint flow, 
or spray pattern.

• Spray gun being held too far from the surface. 

• Material being improperly thinned or the wrong 
reducers being used with the finish coats.

The affected area needs to be sanded and recoated.

Painting Trim and Identification Marks
Masking and Applying the Trim
At this point in the project, the entire aircraft has been painted 
with the base color and all the masking paper and tape 
carefully removed. Refer again to the coating manufacturer’s 

technical data sheet for “dry and recoat” times for the 
appropriate temperatures and “dry to tape” time that must 
elapse before safe application and removal of tape on new 
paint without it lifting. 

Masking Materials
When masking for the trim lines, use 3M® Fine Line tape. It 
is solvent proof, available in widths of 1⁄8–1 inch and, when 
applied properly, produces a sharp edge paint line. A good 
quality masking tape should be used with masking paper to 
cover all areas not being trimmed to ensure the paper does not 
lift and allow overspray on the basecoat. Do not use newspaper 
to mask the work as paint penetrates newspaper. Using actual 
masking paper is more efficient, especially if with a masking 
paper/tape dispenser as part of the finishing equipment. 

Masking for the Trim
After the base color has dried and cured for the recommended 
time shown in the manufacturer’s technical data sheet, the 
next step is to mask for the trim. The trim design can be 
simple, with one or two color stripes running along the 
fuselage, or it can be an elaborate scheme covering the entire 
aircraft. Whichever is chosen, the basic masking steps are 
the same. 

If unsure of a design, there are numerous websites that 
provide the information and software to do a professional 
job. If electing to design a personalized paint scheme, the 
proposed design should be portrayed on a silhouette drawing 
of the aircraft as close to scale as possible. It is much easier 
to change a drawing than to remask the aircraft.

Start by identifying a point on the aircraft from which to 
initiate the trim lines using the Fine Line tape. If the lines 
are straight and/or have large radius curves, use ¾-inch or 
one-inch tape and keep it pulled tight. The wider tape is much 
easier to control when masking a straight line. Smaller radius 
curves may require ½-inch or even ¼-inch tape. Try and use 
the widest tape that lays flat and allows for a smooth curve. 
Use a small roller (like those used for wallpaper seams) to 
go back over and roll the tape edges firmly onto the surface 
to ensure they are flat.

Finish masking the trim lines on one side of the aircraft, 
to include the fuselage, vertical fin and rudder, the engine 
nacelles and wing(s). Once complete, examine the lines. If 
adjustments are needed to the placement or design, now is 
the time to correct it. With one side of the aircraft complete, 
the entire design and placement can be transferred to the 
opposite side.

Different methods can be employed to transfer the placement 
of the trim lines from one side of the aircraft to the other. 


8-17

One method is to trace the design on paper and then apply it 
to the other side, starting at the same point opposite the first 
starting point. Another method is to use the initial starting 
point and apply the trim tape using sheet metal or rivet lines 
as reference, along with measurements, to position the tape 
in the correct location. 

When both sides are completed, a picture can be taken of 
each side and a comparison made to verify the tape lines on 
each side of the aircraft are identical.

With the Fine Line taping complete, some painters apply a 
sealing strip of ¾-inch or 1-inch masking tape covering half 
and extending over the outside edge of the Fine Line tape. 
This provides a wider area to apply the masking paper and 
adds an additional seal to the Fine Line tape. Now, apply 
the masking paper using 1-inch tape, placing half the width 
of the tape on the paper and half on the masked trim tape. 

Use only masking paper made for painting and a comparable 
quality masking tape. With all the trim masking complete, 
cover the rest of the exposed areas of the aircraft to prevent 
overspray from landing on the base color. Tape the edges 
of the covering material to ensure the spray does not drift 
under it. 

Now, scuff-sand all the area of trim to be painted to remove 
the gloss of the base paint. The use of 320-grit for the main 
area and a fine mesh Scotch-Brite pad next to the tape line 
should be sufficient. Then, blow all the dust and grit off the 
aircraft, and wipe down the newly sanded trim area with a 
degreaser and a tack cloth. Press or roll down the trim tape 
edges one more time before painting.

There are some various methods used by painters to ensure 
that a sharp defined tape line is attained upon removal of the 
tape. The basic step is to first use the 3M® Fine Line tape 
to mask the trim line. Some painters then spray a light coat 
of the base color or clear coat just prior to spraying the trim 
color. This will seal the tape edge line and ensure a clean 
sharp line when the tape is removed. 

If multiple colors are used for the trim, cover the trim areas 
not to be sprayed with masking paper. When the first color 
is sprayed and dried, remove the masking paper from the 
next trim area to spray and cover the trim area that was first 
sprayed, taking care not to press the masking paper or tape 
into the freshly dried paint. 

With all the trim completed, the masking paper should be 
removed as soon as the last trimmed area is dry to the touch. 
Carefully remove the Fine Line trim edge tape by slowly 
pulling it back onto itself at a sharp angle. Remove all trim 

and masking tape from the base coat as soon as possible to 
preclude damage to the paint. 

As referenced previously, use compatible paint components 
from the same manufacturer when painting trim over the 
base color. This reduces the possibility of an adverse reaction 
between the base coat and the trim colors.    

Display of Nationality and Registration Marks 
The complete regulatory requirement for identification and 
marking of a U.S.-registered aircraft can be found in Title 
14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR), Part 45, 
Identification and Registration Marking. 

In summary, the regulation states that the marks must:

• Be painted on the aircraft or affixed by other means 
to insure a similar degree of permanence;

• Have no ornamentation;

• Contrast in color with the background; and

• Be legible.

The letters and numbers may be taped off and applied at the 
same time and using the same methods as when the trim is 
applied, or they may be applied later as decals of the proper 
size and color.

Display of Marks
Each operator of an aircraft shall display on the aircraft 
marks consisting of the Roman capital letter “N” (denoting 
United States registration) followed by the registration 
number of the aircraft. Each suffix letter must also be a 
Roman capital letter.
  
Location and Placement of Marks
On fixed-wing aircraft, marks must be displayed on either the 
vertical tail surfaces or the sides of the fuselage. If displayed 
on the vertical tail surfaces, they shall be horizontal on both 
surfaces of a single vertical tail or on the outer surfaces of a 
multivertical tail. If displayed on the fuselage surfaces, then 
horizontally on both sides of the fuselage between the trailing 
edge of the wing and the leading edge of the horizontal 
stabilizer. Exceptions to the location and size requirement 
for certain aircraft can be found in 14 CFR part 45. 

On rotorcraft, marks must be displayed horizontally on both 
surfaces of the cabin, fuselage, boom, or tail. On airships, 
balloons, powered parachutes, and weight-shift control 
aircraft, display marks as required by 14 CFR part 45.


8-18

Size Requirements for Different Aircraft
Almost universally for U.S.-registered, standard certificated, 
fixed-wing aircraft, the marks must be at least 12 inches high. 
A glider may display marks at least 3 inches high.

In all cases, the marks must be of equal height, two-thirds 
as wide as they are high, and the characters must be formed 
by solid lines one-sixth as wide as they are high. The letters 
“M” and “W” may be as wide as they are high.

The spacing between each character may not be less than one-
fourth of the character width. The marks required by 14 CFR 
part 45 for fixed-wing aircraft must have the same height, 
width, thickness, and spacing on both sides of the aircraft.

The marks must be painted or, if decalcomanias (decals), 
be affixed in a permanent manner. Other exceptions to the 
size and location of the marks are applicable to aircraft with 
Special Airworthiness certificates and those penetrating 
ADIZ and DEWIZ airspace. The current 14 CFR part 45 
should be consulted for a complete copy of the rules.

Decals
Markings are placed on aircraft surfaces to provide servicing 
instructions, fuel and oil specifications, tank capacities, and 
to identify lifting and leveling points, walkways, battery 
locations, or any areas that should be identified. These 
markings can be applied by stenciling or by using decals.

Decals are used instead of painted instructions because 
they are usually less expensive and easier to apply. Decals 
used on aircraft are usually of three types: paper, metal, or 
vinyl film. These decals are suitable for exterior and interior 
surface application.

To assure proper adhesion of decals, clean all surfaces 
thoroughly with aliphatic naphtha to remove grease, oil, wax, 
or foreign matter. Porous surfaces should be sealed and rough 
surfaces sanded, followed by cleaning to remove any residue.

The instructions to be followed for applying decals are 
usually printed on the reverse side of each decal. A general 
application procedure for each type of decal is presented in 
the following paragraphs to provide familiarization with the 
techniques involved.

Paper Decals
Immerse paper decals in clean water for 1 to 3 minutes. 
Allowing decals to soak longer than 3 minutes causes the 
backing to separate from the decal while immersed. If decals 
are allowed to soak less than 1 minute, the backing does not 
separate from the decal.

Place one edge of the decal on the prepared receiving surface 
and press lightly, then slide the paper backing from beneath the 
decal. Perform any minor alignment with the fingers. Remove 
water by gently blotting the decal and adjacent area with a 
soft, absorbent cloth. Remove air or water bubbles trapped 
under the decal by wiping carefully toward the nearest edge 
of the decal with a cloth. Allow the decal to dry. 

Metal Decals with Cellophane Backing
Apply metal decals with cellophane backing adhesive  
as follows:

1. Immerse the decal in clean, warm water for 1 to 3 
minutes.

2. Remove it from the water and dry carefully with a 
clean cloth.

3. Remove the cellophane backing, but do not touch 
adhesive.

4. Position one edge of the decal on the prepared receiving 
surface. On large foil decals, place the center on the 
receiving surface and work outward from the center 
to the edges.

5. Remove all air pockets by rolling firmly with a rubber 
roller, and press all edges tightly against the receiving 
surface to ensure good adhesion.

Metal Decals With Paper Backing
Metal decals with a paper backing are applied similarly 
to those having a cellophane backing. However, it is not 
necessary to immerse the decal in water to remove the backing. 
It may be peeled from the decal without moistening. Follow 
the manufacturer’s recommendation for activation of the 
adhesive, if necessary, before application. The decal should 
be positioned and smoothed out following the procedures 
given for cellophane-backed decals.

Metal Decals with No Adhesive
Apply decals with no adhesive in the following manner:

1. Apply one coat of cement, Military Specification 
MIL-A-5092, to the decal and prepared receiving 
surface.

2. Allow cement to dry until both surfaces are tacky.

3. Apply the decal and smooth it down to remove air 
pockets.

4. Remove excess adhesive with a cloth dampened with 
aliphatic naphtha.

Vinyl Film Decals
To apply vinyl film decals, separate the paper backing from 
the plastic film. Remove any paper backing adhering to 
the adhesive by rubbing the area gently with a clean cloth 


8-19

saturated with water. Remove small pieces of remaining paper 
with masking tape.

1. Place vinyl film, adhesive side up, on a clean porous 
surface, such as wood or blotter paper.

2. Apply recommended activator to the adhesive in firm, 
even strokes to the adhesive side of decal.

3. Position the decal in the proper location, while 
adhesive is still tacky, with only one edge contacting 
the prepared surface.

4. Work a roller across the decal with overlapping strokes 
until all air bubbles are removed.

Removal of Decals 
Paper decals can be removed by rubbing the decal with a cloth 
dampened with lacquer thinner. If the decals are applied over 
painted or doped surfaces, use lacquer thinner sparingly to 
prevent removing the paint or dope.

Remove metal decals by moistening the edge of the foil with 
aliphatic naphtha and peeling the decal from the adhering 
surface. Work in a well-ventilated area.

Vinyl film decals are removed by placing a cloth saturated 
with MEK on the decal and scraping with a plastic scraper. 
Remove the remaining adhesive by wiping with a cloth 
dampened with a dry-cleaning solvent.

Paint System Compatibility
The use of several different types of paint, coupled with 
several proprietary coatings, makes repair of damaged and 
deteriorated areas particularly difficult. Paint finishes are not 
necessarily compatible  with each other. The following general 
rules for coating compatibility are included for information 
and are not necessarily listed in order of importance:

1. Old type zinc chromate primer may be used directly for 
touchup of bare metal surfaces and for use on interior 
finishes. It may be overcoated with wash primers if it 
is in good condition. Acrylic lacquer finishes do not 
adhere to this material.

2. Modified zinc chromate primer does not adhere 
satisfactorily to bare metal. It must never be used over 
a dried film of acrylic nitrocellulose lacquer.

3. Nitrocellulose coatings adhere to acrylic finishes, but 
the reverse is not true. Acrylic nitrocellulose lacquers 
may not be used over old nitrocellulose finishes.

4. Acrylic nitrocellulose lacquers adhere poorly to bare 
metal and both nitrocellulose and epoxy finishes. For 
best results, the lacquers must be applied over fresh, 
successive coatings of wash primer and modified zinc 
chromate. They also adhere to freshly applied epoxy 
coatings (dried less than 6 hours).

5. Epoxy topcoats adhere to any paint system that is in 
good condition, and may be used for general touchup, 
including touchup of defects in baked enamel coatings.

6. Old wash primer coats may be overcoated directly with 
epoxy finishes. A new second coat of wash primer 
must be applied if an acrylic finish is to be applied.

7. Old acrylic finishes may be refinished with new 
acrylic if the old coating is softened using acrylic 
nitrocellulose thinner before touchup.

8. Damage to epoxy finishes can best be repaired by 
using more epoxy, since neither of the lacquer finishes 
stick to the epoxy surface. In some instances, air-
drying enamels may be used for touchup of epoxy 
coatings if edges of damaged areas are abraded with 
fine sandpaper. 

Paint Touchup
Paint touchup may be required on an aircraft following 
repair to the surface substrate. Touchup may also be used to 
cover minor topcoat damage, such as scratches, abrasions, 
permanent stains, and fading of the trim colors. One of the 
first steps is to identify the paint that needs to be touched up. 

Identification of Paint Finishes
Existing finishes on current aircraft may be any one of several 
types, a combination of two or more types, or combinations 
of general finishes with special proprietary coatings.

Any of the finishes may be present at any given time, and 
repairs may have been made using material from several 
different type coatings. Some detailed information for 
the identification of each finish is necessary to ensure 
the topcoat application does not react adversely with the 
undercoat. A simple test can be used to confirm the nature 
of the coatings present. 

The following procedure aids in identification of the paint 
finish. Apply a coating of engine oil (MIL SPEC, MIL-
PRF-7808, turbine oil, or equivalent) to a small area of the 
surface to be checked. Old nitrocellulose finishes soften 
within a period of a few minutes. Acrylic and epoxy finishes 
show no effects.

If still not identified, wipe a small area of the surface in 
question with a rag wet with MEK. The MEK picks up 
the pigment from an acrylic finish, but has no effect on an 
epoxy coating. Just wipe the surface, and do not rub. Heavy 
rubbing picks up even epoxy pigment from coatings that are 
not thoroughly cured. Do not use MEK on nitrocellulose 
finishes. Figure 8-22 provides a solvent test to identify the 
coating on an aircraft.

Surface Preparation for Touchup
In the case of a repair and touchup, once the aircraft paint 
coating has been identified, the surface preparation follows 
some basic rules.

The first rule, as with the start of any paint project, is to wash 
and wipe down the area with a degreaser and silicone wax 
remover before starting to sand or abrade the area.
  
If a whole panel or section within a seam line can be 
refinished during a touchup, it eliminates having to match 
and blend the topcoat to an existing finish. The area of repair 
should be stripped to a seam line and the finish completely 
redone from wash primer to the topcoat, as applicable. The 
paint along the edge of the stripped area should be hand-
sanded wet and feathered with a 320-grade paper. 

For a spot repair that requires blending of the coating, an area 
about three times the area of the actual repair will need to 
be prepared for blending of the paint. If the damaged area is 
through the primer to the substrate, the repair area should be 
abraded with 320 aluminum oxide paper on a double-action 
(D/A) air sander. Then, the repair and the surrounding area 
should be wet sanded using the air sander fitted with 1500 
wet paper. The area should then be wiped with a tack cloth 
prior to spraying.

Apply a crosscoat of epoxy primer to the bare metal area, 
following the material data sheet for drying and recoat 
times. Abrade the primer area lightly with 1500 wet or dry, 
and then abrade the unsanded area around the repair with 
cutting compound. Clean and wipe the area with a degreasing 
solvent, such as isopropyl alcohol, and then a tack cloth.

Mix the selected topcoat paint that is compatible for the repair. 
Apply two light coats over the sanded repair area, slightly 
extending the second coat beyond the first. Allow time for 
the first coat to flash before applying the second coat. Then, 
thin the topcoat by one-third to one-half with a compatible 
reducer and apply one more coat, extending beyond the first 
two coats. Allow to dry according to the material data sheet 
before buffing and polishing the blended area. 

If the damage did not penetrate the primer, and only the 
topcoat is needed for the finish, complete the same steps that 
would follow a primer coat. 
 
Paint touchup procedures generally are the same for almost 
any repair. The end result, however, is affected by numerous 
variables, which include the preparation, compatibility of the 
finishing materials, color match, selection of reducers and/or 
retarders based on temperature, and experience and expertise 
of the painter.

Stripping the Finish
The most experienced painter, the best finishing equipment, 
and newest coatings, do not produce the desired finish on 
an aircraft if the surface was not properly prepared prior 
to refinishing. Surface preparation for painting of an entire 
aircraft typically starts with the removal of the paint. This 
is done not only for the weight reduction that is gained by 
stripping the many gallons of topcoats and primers, but for the 
opportunity to inspect and repair corrosion or other defects 
uncovered by the removal of the paint. 

Before any chemical stripping can be performed, all areas 
of the aircraft not being stripped must be protected. The 


8-21

stripper manufacturer can recommend protective material 
for this purpose. This normally includes all window material, 
vents and static ports, rubber seals and tires, and composite 
components that may be affected by the chemicals. 

The removal of paint from an aircraft, even a small single-
engine model, involves not only the labor but a concern 
for the environment. You should recognize the impact and 
regulatory requirements that are necessary to dispose of the 
water and coating materials removed from the aircraft.  
  
Chemical Stripping
At one time, most chemical strippers contained methylene 
chloride, considered an environmentally acceptable chemical 
until 1990. It was very effective in removing multiple 
layers of paint. However, in 1990, it was listed as a toxic air 
contaminant that caused cancer and other medical problems 
and was declared a Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) by the 
EPA in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

Since then, other substitute chemical strippers were tested, 
from formic acid to benzyl alcohol. None of them were found 
to be particularly effective in removing multiple layers of 
paint. Most of them were not friendly to the environment.
 
One of the more recent entries into the chemical stripping 
business is an environmentally friendly product known as 
EFS-2500, which works by breaking the bond between the 
substrate and primer. This leads to a secondary action that 
causes the paint to lift both primer and top coat off the surface 
as a single film. Once the coating is lifted, it is easily removed 
with a squeegee or high-pressure water. 

This product differs from conventional chemical strippers by 
not melting the coatings. Cleanup is easier, and the product 
complies with EPA rules on emissions. Additionally, it 
passed Boeing testing specifications related to sandwich 
corrosion, immersion corrosion, and hydrogen embrittlement. 
EFS-2500 has no chlorinated components, is non-acidic, 
nonflammable, nonhazardous, biodegradable, and has 
minimal to no air pollution potential.

The stripper can be applied using existing common methods, 
such as airless spraying, brushing, rolling, or immersion in a 
tank. It works on all metals, including aluminum, magnesium, 
cadmium plate, titanium, wood, fiberglass, ceramic, concrete, 
plaster, and stone. 

Plastic Media Blasting (PMB)
Plastic media blasting (PMB) is one of the stripping methods 
that reduces and may eliminate a majority of environmental 
pollution problems that can be associated with the earlier 
formulations of some chemical stripping. PMB is a dry 

abrasive blasting process designed to replace chemical paint 
stripping operations. PMB is similar to conventional sand 
blasting except that soft, angular plastic particles are used as 
the blasting medium. The process has minimum effect on the 
surface under the paint because of the plastic medium and 
relatively low air pressure used in the process. The media, 
when processed through a reclamation system, can be reused 
up to 10 times before it becomes too small to effectively 
remove the paint. 

PMB is most effective on metal surfaces, but it has been 
used successfully on composite surfaces after it was found 
to produce less visual damage than removing the paint  
by sanding. 

New Stripping Methods
Various methods and materials for stripping paint and other 
coatings are under development and include:

• A laser stripping process used to remove coatings from 
composites.

• Carbon dioxide pellets (dry ice) used in conjunction 
with a pulsed flashlamp that rapidly heats a thin layer 
of paint, which is then blasted away by the ice pellets.

Safety in the Paint Shop
All paint booths and shops must have adequate ventilation 
systems installed that not only remove the toxic air but, when 
properly operating, reduce and/or eliminate overspray and 
dust from collecting on the finish. All electric motors used in 
the fans and exhaust system should be grounded and enclosed 
to eliminate sparks. The lighting systems and all bulbs should 
be covered and protected against breakage.
 
Proper respirators and fresh air breathing systems must 
be available to all personnel involved in the stripping 
and painting process. When mixing any paint or two-part 
coatings, eye protection and respirators should be worn. 
 
An appropriate number and size of the proper class fire 
extinguishers should be available in the shop or hangar 
during all spraying operations. They should be weighed and 
certified, as required, to ensure they work in the event they 
are needed. Fireproof containers should be available for the 
disposal of all paint and solvent soaked rags.
 
Storage of Finishing Materials
All chemical components that are used to paint an aircraft 
burn in their liquid state. They should be stored away from 
all sources of heat or flames. The ideal place would be in 
fireproof metal cabinets located in a well-ventilated area. 


8-22

Some of the finishing components have a shelf life listed in 
the material or technical data sheet supplied by the coating 
manufacturer. Those materials should be marked on the 
container, with a date of purchase, in the event that they are 
not used immediately. 

Protective Equipment for Personnel
The process of painting, stripping, or refinishing an 
aircraft requires the use of various coatings, chemicals, and 
procedures that may be hazardous if proper precautions are 
not utilized to protect personnel involved in their use.

The most significant hazards are airborne chemicals inhaled 
either from the vapors of opened paint containers or atomized 
mist resulting from spraying applications. There are two 
types of devices available to protect against airborne hazards: 
respirators and forced-air breathing systems. 

A respirator is a device worn over the nose and mouth to 
filter particles and organic vapors from the air being inhaled. 
The most common type incorporate double charcoal-filtered 
cartridges with replaceable dust filters that fits to the face over 
the nose and mouth with a tight seal. When properly used, this 
type of respirator provides protection against the inhalation of 
organic vapors, dust, mists of paints, lacquers, and enamels. 
A respirator does not provide protection against paints and 
coatings containing isocyanates (polyurethane paint). 

A respirator must be used in an area of adequate ventilation. 
If breathing becomes difficult, there is a smell or taste the 
contaminant(s), or an individual becomes dizzy or feel 
nauseous, they should leave the area and seek fresh air 
and assistance as necessary. Carefully read the warnings 
furnished with each respirator describing the limits and 
materials for which they provide protection.

A forced-air breathing system must be used when spraying 
any type of polyurethane or any coating that contains 
isocyanates. It is also recommended for all spraying and 
stripping of any type, whether chemical or media blasting. 
The system provides a constant source of fresh air for 
breathing, which is pumped into the mask through a hose 
from an electric turbine pump. 

Protective clothing, such as Tyvek® coveralls, should be 
worn that not only protects personnel from the paint but also 
help keep dust off the painted surfaces. Rubber gloves must 
be worn when any stripper, etching solution, conversion 
coatings, and solvent is used. 

When solvents are used for cleaning paint equipment and 
spray guns, the area must be free of any open flame or other 
heat source. Solvent should not be randomly sprayed into 
the atmosphere when cleaning the guns. Solvents should not 
be used to wash or clean paint and other coatings from bare 
hands and arms. Use protective gloves and clothing during 
all spraying operations.

In most states, there are Occupational Safety Hazard 
Administration (OSHA) regulations in effect that may require 
personnel to be protected from vapors and other hazards while 
on the job. In any hangar or shop, personnel must be vigilant 
and provide and use protection for safety.

Aircraft Electrical System
Introduction
The satisfactory performance of any modern aircraft depends 
to a very great degree on the continuing reliability of electrical 
systems and subsystems. Improperly or carelessly installed 
or maintained wiring can be a source of both immediate 
and potential danger. The continued proper performance of 
electrical systems depends on the knowledge and technique 
of the mechanic who installs, inspects, and maintains the 
electrical system wires and cables.

Figure 9-1. Ohm's Law used to calculate how much current a lamp 
will pass when connected to a 24-volt DC power source.

Ohm’s Law
Ohm’s Law describes the basic mathematical relationships 
of electricity. The law was named after German Physicist 
George Simon Ohm (1789–1854). Basically, Ohm’s Law 
states that the current (electron flow) through a conductor 
is directly proportional to the voltage (electrical pressure) 
applied to that conductor and inversely proportional to 
the resistance of the conductor. The unit used to measure 
resistance is called the ohm. The symbol for the ohm is the 
Greek letter omega (Ω). In mathematical formulas, the capital 
letter R refers to resistance. The resistance of a conductor and 
the voltage applied to it determine the number of amperes 
of current flowing through the conductor. Thus, 1 ohm of 
resistance limits the current flow to 1 ampere in a conductor 
to which a voltage of 1 volt is applied. The primary formula 
derived from Ohm’s Law is: E = I × R (E = electromotive 
force measured in volts, I = current flow measured in amps, 
and R = resistance measured in ohms). This formula can also 
be written to solve for current or resistance:
 

I = E
 R

R = E
 I

Ohm’s Law provides a foundation of mathematical formulas 
that predict how electricity responds to certain conditions. 
[Figure 9-1] For example, Ohm’s Law can be used to 
calculate that a lamp of 12 Ohms (Ω) passes a current of 
2 amps when connected to a 24-volt direct current (DC) 
power source. 

Example 1
A 28-volt landing light circuit has a lamp with 4 ohms of 
resistance. Calculate the total current of the circuit.



I = E
 R

I =   28 volts
      4Ω

I = 7 amps

Example 2
A 28-volt deice boot circuit has a current of 6.5 amps. 
Calculate the resistance of the deice boot.

R = E
 I

R =   28 volts
        6.5 amps

R = 4.31Ω
 
Example 3
A taxi light has a resistance of 4.9Ω and a total current of 
2.85 amps. Calculate the system voltage.
 
E = I × R

E = 2.85 × 4.9Ω

E = 14 volts

Whenever troubleshooting aircraft electrical circuits, 
it is always valuable to consider Ohm’s Law. A good 
understanding of the relationship between resistance and 
current flow can help one determine if a circuit contains an 
open or a short. Remembering that a low resistance means 
increased current can help explain why circuit breakers pop 
or fuses blow. In almost all cases, aircraft loads are wired in 
parallel to each other; therefore, there is a constant voltage 
supplied to all loads and the current flow through a load is a 
function of that load’s resistance. 

Figure 9-2 illustrates several ways of using Ohm’s Law for 
the calculation of current, voltage, and resistance.

Current
Electrical current is the movement of electrons. This electron 
movement is referred to as current, flow, or current flow. In 
practical terms, this movement of electrons must take place 
within a conductor (wire). Current is typically measured in 
amps. The symbol for current is I and the symbol for amps is A. 

The current flow is actually the movement of the free 
electrons found within conductors. Common conductors

include copper, silver, aluminum, and gold. The term “free 
electron” describes a condition in some atoms where the 
outer electrons are loosely bound to their parent atom. These 
loosely bound electrons are easily motivated to move in a 
given direction when an external source, such as a battery, 
is applied to the circuit. These electrons are attracted to the 
positive terminal of the battery, while the negative terminal 
is the source of the electrons. So, the measure of current is 
actually the number of electrons moving through a conductor 
in a given amount of time.

The internationally accepted unit for current is the ampere 
(A). One ampere (A) of current is equivalent to 1 coulomb 
(C) of charge passing through a conductor in 1 second. One 
coulomb of charge equals 6.28 × 1018 electrons. Obviously, 
the unit of amperes is a much more convenient term to use 
than coulombs. The unit of coulombs is simply too small to 
be practical. 

When current flow is in one direction, it is called direct 
current (DC). Later in the text, the form of current that 
periodically oscillates back and forth within the circuit is 

discussed. The present discussion is concerned only with 
the use of DC. It should be noted that as with the movement 
of any mass, electron movement (current flow) only occurs 
when there is a force present to push the electrons. This force 
is commonly called voltage (described in more detail in the 
next section). When a voltage is applied across the conductor, 
an electromotive force creates an electric field within the 
conductor, and a current is established. The electrons do not 
move in a straight direction, but undergo repeated collisions 
with other nearby atoms within a conductor. These collisions 
usually knock other free electrons from their atoms, and these 
electrons move on toward the positive end of the conductor 
with an average velocity called the drift velocity, which is 
relatively low speed. To understand the nearly instantaneous 
speed of the effect of the current, it is helpful to visualize a 
long tube filled with steel balls. [Figure 9-3] 

It can be seen that a ball introduced in one end of the tube, 
which represents the conductor, immediately causes a ball 
to be emitted at the opposite end of the tube. Thus, electric 
current can be viewed as instantaneous, even though it is the 
result of a relatively slow drift of electrons. 

Conventional Current Theory and Electron Theory 
There are two competing schools of thought regarding the 
flow of electricity. The two explanations are the conventional 
current theory and the electron theory. Both theories 
describe the movement of electrons through a conductor. 
They simply explain the direction current moves. Typically 
during troubleshooting or the connection of electrical circuits, 
the use of either theory can be applied as long as it is used 
consistently. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
officially defines current flow using electron theory (negative 
to positive). 

The conventional current theory was initially advanced by 
Benjamin Franklin, who reasoned that current flowed out of 
a positive source into a negative source or an area that lacked 
an abundance of charge. The notation assigned to the electric 
charges was positive (+) for the abundance of charge and 
negative (−) for a lack of charge. It then seemed natural to 
visualize the flow of current as being from the positive (+) 
to the negative (−). Later discoveries were made that proved 
that just the opposite is true. Electron theory describes what 
actually happens in the case of an abundance of electrons 
flowing out of the negative (−) source to an area that lacks

electrons or the positive (+) source. Both conventional flow 
and electron flow are used in industry. 

Electromotive Force (Voltage)
Voltage is most easily described as electrical pressure force. 
It is the electromotive force (EMF), or the push or pressure 
from one end of the conductor to the other, that ultimately 
moves the electrons. The symbol for EMF is the capital letter 
E. EMF is always measured between two points and voltage 
is considered a value between two points. For example, 
across the terminals of the typical aircraft battery, voltage 
can be measured as the potential difference of 12 volts or 
24 volts. That is to say that between the two terminal posts 
of the battery, there is a voltage available to push current 
through a circuit. Free electrons in the negative terminal of 
the battery move toward the excessive number of positive 
charges in the positive terminal. The net result is a flow or 
current through a conductor. There cannot be a flow in a 
conductor unless there is an applied voltage from a battery, 
generator, or ground power unit. The potential difference, 
or the voltage across any two points in an electrical system, 
can be determined by: 

V1 – V2 = VDrop

Example
The voltage at one point is 14 volts. The voltage at a second 
point in the circuit is 12.1 volts. To calculate the voltage drop, 
use the formula above to get a total voltage drop of 1.9 volts.

 Figure 9-4 illustrates the flow of electrons of electric current. 
Two interconnected water tanks demonstrate that when a 
difference of pressure exists between the two tanks, water 
flows until the two tanks are equalized. Figure 9-4 shows 
the level of water in tank A to be at a higher level, reading 
10 pounds per square inch (psi) (higher potential energy), 
than the water level in tank B, reading 2 psi (lower potential 
energy). Between the two tanks, there is 8 psi potential 
difference. If the valve in the interconnecting line between the 
tanks is opened, water flows from tank A into tank B until the 
level of water (potential energy) of both tanks is equalized. 
It is important to note that it was not the pressure in tank A  

that caused the water to flow; rather, it was the difference 
in pressure between tank A and tank B that caused the flow. 
This comparison illustrates the principle that electrons move, 
when a path is available, from a point of excess electrons 
(higher potential energy) to a point deficient in electrons 
(lower potential energy). The force that causes this movement 
is the potential difference in electrical energy between the two 
points. This force is called the electrical pressure (voltage), 
the potential difference, or the electromotive force (electron 
moving force).

Resistance
The two fundamental properties of current and voltage 
are related by a third property known as resistance. In any 
electrical circuit, when voltage is applied to it, a current 
results. The resistance of the conductor determines the 
amount of current that flows under the given voltage. In 
general, the greater the circuit resistance, the less the current. 
If the resistance is reduced, then the current will increase. 
This relation is linear in nature and is known as Ohm’s Law. 
An example would be if the resistance of a circuit is doubled, 
and the voltage is held constant, then the current through the 
resistor is cut in half. 

There is no distinct dividing line between conductors and 
insulators; under the proper conditions, all types of material 
conduct some current. Materials offering a resistance to 
current flow midway between the best conductors and the 
poorest conductors (insulators) are sometimes referred to 
as semiconductors and find their greatest application in the 
field of transistors.

The best conductors are materials, chiefly metals, that possess 
a large number of free electrons. Conversely, insulators are 
materials having few free electrons. The best conductors are 
silver, copper, gold, and aluminum, but some nonmetals, such 
as carbon and water, can be used as conductors. Materials 
such as rubber, glass, ceramics, and plastics are such poor 
conductors that they are usually used as insulators. The 
current flow in some of these materials is so low that it is 
usually considered zero.

Factors Affecting Resistance
The resistance of a metallic conductor is dependent on the 
type of conductor material. It has been pointed out that certain 
metals are commonly used as conductors because of the 
large number of free electrons in their outer orbits. Copper 
is usually considered the best available conductor material, 
since a copper wire of a particular diameter offers a lower 
resistance to current flow than an aluminum wire of the same 
diameter. However, aluminum is much lighter than copper, 
and for this reason, as well as cost considerations, aluminum 
is often used when the weight factor is important.

The resistance of a metallic conductor is directly proportional 
to its length. The longer the length of a given size of wire, the 
greater the resistance. Figure 9-5 shows two wire conductors 
of different lengths. If 1 volt of electrical pressure is applied 
across the two ends of the conductor that is 1 foot in length 
and the resistance to the movement of free electrons is 
assumed to be 1 ohm, the current flow is limited to 1 ampere. 
If the same size conductor is doubled in length, the same 
electrons set in motion by the 1 volt applied now find twice 
the resistance.

Electromagnetic Generation of Power
Electrical energy can be produced through a number of 
methods. Common methods include the use of light, pressure, 
heat, chemical, and electromagnetic induction. Of these 
processes, electromagnetic induction is most responsible for 
the generation of the majority of the electrical power used 
by humans. Virtually all mechanical devices (generators and 
alternators) that produce electrical power employ the process 
of electromagnetic induction. The use of light, pressure, 
heat, and chemical sources for electrical power is found on 
aircraft but produce a minimal amount of all the electrical 
power consumed during a typical flight.

In brief, light can produce electricity using a solar cell 
(photovoltaic cell). These cells contain a certain chemical 
that converts light energy into voltage/current. 

Using pressure to generate electrical power is commonly 
known as the piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric effect 
(piezo or piez taken from Greek: to press; pressure; to 
squeeze) is a result of the application of mechanical pressure 
on a dielectric or nonconducting crystal.

Chemical energy can be converted into electricity, most 
commonly in the form of a battery. A primary battery 

produces electricity using two different metals in a chemical 
solution like alkaline electrolyte. A chemical reaction exists 
between the metals which frees more electrons in one metal 
than in the other.

Heat used to produce electricity creates the thermoelectric 
effect. When a device called a thermocouple is subjected to 
heat, a voltage is produced. A thermocouple is a junction 
between two different metals that produces a voltage related 
to a temperature difference. If the thermocouple is connected 
to a complete circuit, a current also flows. Thermocouples are 
often found on aircraft as part of a temperature monitoring 
system, such as a cylinder head temperature gauge. 

Electromagnetic induction is the process of producing a 
voltage (EMF) by moving a magnetic field in relationship 
to a conductor. As shown in Figure 9-6, when a conductor 
(wire) is moved through a magnetic field, an EMF is produced 
in the conductor. If a complete circuit is connected to the 
conductor, the voltage also produces a current flow. 

One single conductor does not produce significant voltage/
current via electromagnetic induction. [Figure 9-6] In 
practice, instead of a single wire, a coil of wire is moved 
through the magnetic field of a strong magnet. This produces 
a greater electrical output. In many cases, the magnetic field 
is created by using a powerful electromagnet. This allows 
for the production of a greater voltage/current due to the 
stronger magnetic field produced by the electromagnet when 
compared to an ordinary magnet.

Please note that this text often refers to voltage/current in 
regards to electrical power. Remember voltage (electrical 
pressure) must be present to produce a current (electron flow). 
Hence, the output energy generated through the process 
of electromagnetic induction always consists of voltage.

Current also results when a complete circuit is connected to 
that voltage. Electrical power is produced when there is both 
electrical pressure E (EMF) and current (I). Power = Current 
× Voltage (P = I × E)

It is the relative motion between a conductor and a magnetic 
field that causes current to flow in the conductor. Either the 
conductor or magnet can be moving or stationary. When a 
magnet and its field are moved through a coiled conductor, 
as shown in Figure 9-7, a DC voltage with a specific polarity 
is produced. The polarity of this voltage depends on the 
direction in which the magnet is moved and the position of 
the north and south poles of the magnetic field. The generator 
left-hand rule can be used to determine the direction of 

 current flow within the conductor. [Figure 9-8] Of course, 
the direction of current flow is a function of the polarity of 
the voltage induced in to the conductor. 

In practice, producing voltage/current using the process 
of electromagnetic induction requires a rotating machine. 
Generally speaking, on all aircraft, a generator or alternator 
employs the principles of electromagnetic induction to create 
electrical power for the aircraft. Either the magnetic field 
can rotate or the conductor can rotate. [Figure 9-9] The 
rotating component is driven by a mechanical device, such 
as an aircraft engine.

During the process of electromagnetic induction, the value of 
the induced voltage/current depends on three basic factors: 

1. Number of turns in the conductor coil (more loops 
equals greater induced voltage)

3. Speed of rotation of the conductor or magnet (the 
faster the rotation, the greater the induced voltage) 

Figure 9-10 illustrates the basics of a rotating machine used 
to produce voltage. The simple generating device consists 
of a rotating loop, marked A and B, placed between two 
magnetic poles, N and S. The ends of the loop are connected 
to two metal slip rings (collector rings), C1 and C2. Current 
is taken from the collector rings by brushes. If the loop is 
considered as separate wires, A and B, and the left-hand rule 
for generators is applied, then it can be observed that as wire 
B moves up across the field, a voltage is induced that causes 
the current to flow towards the reader. As wire A moves down 
across the field, a voltage is induced that causes the current to 
flow away from the reader. When the wires are formed into 
a loop, the voltages induced in the two sides of the loop are 
combined. Therefore, for explanatory purposes, the action 
of either conductor, A or B, while rotating in the magnetic 
field is similar to the action of the loop.

Figure 9-11 illustrates the generation of alternating current 
(AC) with a simple loop conductor rotating in a magnetic 
field. As it is rotated in a counterclockwise direction, varying 
voltages are induced in the conductive loop. 

Position 1
The conductor A moves parallel to the lines of force. Since 
it cuts no lines of force, the induced voltage is zero. As the 

conductor advances from position 1 to position 2, the induced 
voltage gradually increases. 

Position 2
The conductor is now moving in a direction perpendicular 
to the flux and cuts a maximum number of lines of force; 
therefore, a maximum voltage is induced. As the conductor 
moves beyond position 2, it cuts a decreasing amount of flux, 
and the induced voltage decreases. 

Position 3
At this point, the conductor has made half a revolution and 
again moves parallel to the lines of force, and no voltage is 
induced in the conductor. As the A conductor passes position 
3, the direction of induced voltage now reverses since the A 
conductor is moving downward, cutting flux in the opposite 
direction. As the A conductor moves across the south pole, the 
induced voltage gradually increases in a negative direction 
until it reaches position 4.

Position 4
Like position 2, the conductor is again moving perpendicular 
to the flux and generates a maximum negative voltage. 
From position 4 to position 5, the induced voltage gradually 
decreases until the voltage is zero, and the conductor and 
wave are ready to start another cycle. 

Position 5
The curve shown at position 5 is called a sine wave. It

Alternating Current (AC) Introduction 
Alternating current (AC) electrical systems are found on most 
multi-engine, high performance turbine powered aircraft and 
transport category aircraft. AC is the same type of electricity 
used in industry and to power our homes. Direct current (DC) 
is used on systems that must be compatible with battery 
power, such as on light aircraft and automobiles. There are 
many benefits of AC power when selected over DC power 
for aircraft electrical systems.

AC can be transmitted over long distances more readily 
and more economically than DC, since AC voltages can be 
increased or decreased by means of transformers. Because 
more and more units are being operated electrically in 
airplanes, the power requirements are such that a number of 
advantages can be realized by using AC (especially with large 
transport category aircraft). Space and weight can be saved 
since AC devices, especially motors, are smaller and simpler 
than DC devices. In most AC motors, no brushes are required, 
and they require less maintenance than DC motors. Circuit 
breakers operate satisfactorily under loads at high altitudes in 
an AC system, whereas arcing is so excessive on DC systems 
that circuit breakers must be replaced frequently. Finally, 
most airplanes using a 24-volt DC system have special 
equipment that requires a certain amount of 400 cycle AC 
current. For these aircraft, a unit called an inverter is used to 
change DC to AC. Inverters are discussed later in this book. 

AC is constantly changing in value and polarity, or as the 
name implies, alternating. Figure 9-12 shows a graphic 
comparison of DC and AC. The polarity of DC never 
changes, and the polarity and voltage constantly change in 
AC. It should also be noted that the AC cycle repeats at given 
intervals. With AC, both voltage and current start at zero, 
increase, reach a peak, then decrease and reverse polarity. 
If one is to graph this concept, it becomes easy to see the 
alternating wave form. This wave form is typically referred 
to as a sine wave. 

Definitions
Values of AC

There are three values of AC that apply to both voltage and 
current. These values help to define the sine wave and are 
called instantaneous, peak, and effective. It should be noted 
that during the discussion of these terms, the text refers to 
voltage. But remember, the values apply to voltage and 
current in all AC circuits. 

Instantaneous 

An instantaneous voltage is the value at any instant in time 
along the AC wave. The sine wave represents a series of 
these values. The instantaneous value of the voltage varies 
from zero at 0° to maximum at 90°, back to zero at 180°, 
to maximum in the opposite direction at 270°, and to zero 
again at 360°. Any point on the sine wave is considered the 
instantaneous value of voltage. 

Peak 

The peak value is the largest instantaneous value, often 
referred to as the maximum value. The largest single positive 
value occurs after a certain period of time when the sine wave 
reaches 90°, and the largest single negative value occurs 
when the wave reaches 270°. Although important in the 
understanding of the AC sine wave, peak values are seldom 
used by aircraft technicians. 

Effective 

The effective values for voltage are always less than the 
peak (maximum) values of the sine wave and approximate 
DC voltage of the same value. For example, an AC circuit of 
24 volts and 2 amps should produce the same heat through a 
resistor as a DC circuit of 24 volts and 2 amps. The effective 
value is also known as the root mean square, or RMS value, 
which refers to the mathematical process by which the value 
is derived.

Most AC meters display the effective value of the AC. In 
almost all cases, the voltage and current ratings of a system 
or component are given in effective values. In other words, 
the industry ratings are based on effective values. Peak and 
instantaneous values, used only in very limited situations, 
would be stated as such. In the study of AC, any values given 
for current or voltage are assumed to be effective values 
unless otherwise specified. In practice, only the effective 
values of voltage and current are used.

The effective value is equal to .707 times the peak (maximum) 
value. Conversely, the peak value is 1.41 times the effective 
value. Thus, the 110 volt value given for AC is only 0.707 
of the peak voltage of this supply. The maximum voltage is 
approximately 155 volts (110 × 1.41 = 155 volts maximum).

How often the AC waveform repeats is known as the AC 
frequency. The frequency is typically measured in cycles per 
second (CPS) or hertz (Hz). One Hz equals one CPS. The 
time it takes for the sine wave to complete one cycle is known 
as period (P). Period is a value or time period and typically 
measured in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. It 
should be noted that the time period of a cycle can change 
from one system to another; it is always said that the cycle 
completes in 360° (related to the 360° of rotation of an AC 
alternator). [Figure 9-13]

Cycle Defined

A cycle is a completion of a pattern. Whenever a voltage 
or current passes through a series of changes, returns to the 
starting point, and then repeats the same series of changes, 
the series is called a cycle. When the voltage values are 
graphed, as in Figure 9-14, the complete AC cycle is 
displayed. One complete cycle is often referred to as the sine 
wave and said to be 360°. It is typical to start the sine wave 
where the voltage is zero. The voltage then increases to a 
maximum positive value, decreases to a value of zero, then  

increases to a maximum negative value, and again decreases 
to zero. The cycle repeats until the voltage is no longer 
available. There are two alternations in a complete cycle: 
the positive alternation and the negative. It should be noted 
that the polarity of the voltage reverses for each half cycle. 
Therefore, during the positive half cycle, the electron flow 
is considered to be in one direction; during the negative half 
cycle, the electrons reverse direction and flow the opposite 
way through the circuit. 

Frequency Defined

The frequency is the number of cycles of AC per second 
(CPS). The standard unit of frequency measurement is the 
Hz. [Figure 9-15] In a generator, the voltage and current 
pass through a complete cycle of values each time a coil 
or conductor passes under a north and south pole of the 
magnet. The number of cycles for each revolution of the 
coil or conductor is equal to the number of pairs of poles.

The frequency, then, is equal to the number of cycles in 
one revolution multiplied by the number of revolutions  
per second. 

Period Defined 

The time required for a sine wave to complete one full 
cycle is called a period (P). A period is typically measured 
in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. [Figure 9-14] 
The period of a sine wave is inversely proportional to the 
frequency. That is to say that the higher the frequency, the 
shorter the period. The mathematical relationship between 
frequency and period is given as: 

Period

F = 1

Wavelength Defined

The distance that a waveform travels during a period is 
commonly referred to as a wavelength and is indicated by the 
Greek letter lambda (λ). Wavelength is related to frequency 
by the formula:

 wave speed = wavelength 
 frequency
 
The higher the frequency is, the shorter the wavelength is. 
The measurement of wavelength is taken from one point 
on the waveform to a corresponding point on the next 
waveform. [Figure 9-14] Since wavelength is a distance, 
common units of measure include meters, centimeters, 
millimeters, or nanometers. For example, a sound wave of 
frequency 20 Hz would have wavelength of 17 meters and 
a visible red light wave of 4.3 × 10 –12 Hz would have a 
wavelength of roughly 700 nanometers. Keep in mind that 
the actual wavelength depends on the media through which 
the waveform must travel. 

Phase Relationships

Phase is the relationship between two sine waves, typically 
measured in angular degrees. For example, if there are two 
different alternators producing power, it would be easy to 
compare their individual sine waves and determine their 
phase relationship. In Figure 9-16B, there is a 90° phase 
difference between the two voltage waveforms. A phase 
relationship can be between any two sine waves. The phase 
relationship can be measured between two voltages of 
different alternators or the current and voltage produced by 
the same alternator.

Figure 9-16A shows a voltage signal and a current signal 
superimposed on the same time axis. Notice that when the 
voltage increases in the positive alternation that the current 
also increases. When the voltage reaches its peak value, so 
does the current. Both waveforms then reverse and decrease 
back to a zero magnitude, then proceed in the same manner 
in the negative direction as they did in the positive direction. 
When two waves are exactly in step with each other, they 
are said to be in phase. To be in phase, the two waveforms 
must go through their maximum and minimum points at the 
same time and in the same direction.

When two waveforms go through their maximum and 
minimum points at different times, a phase difference exists 
between the two. In this case, the two waveforms are said 
to be out of phase with each other. The terms lead and lag 
are often used to describe the phase difference between 
waveforms. The waveform that reaches its maximum or 
minimum value first is said to lead the other waveform. 
Figure 9-16B shows this relationship. On the other hand, the 
second waveform is said to be lagging the first source. When 
a waveform is said to be leading or lagging, the difference in 
degrees is usually stated. If the two waveforms differ by 360°, 
they are said to be in phase with each other. If there is a 180° 
difference between the two signals, then they are still out of 
phase even though they are both reaching their minimum and 
maximum values at the same time. [Figure 9-16C]

Opposition to Current Flow of AC
There are three factors that can create an opposition to the flow 
of electrons (current) in an AC circuit. Resistance, similar 
to resistance of DC circuits, is measured in ohms and has a 
direct influence on AC regardless of frequency. Inductive 
reactance and capacitive reactance, on the other hand, oppose 
current flow only in AC circuits, not in DC circuits. Since 
AC constantly changes direction and intensity, inductors and 
capacitors may also create an opposition to current flow in 
AC circuits. It should also be noted that inductive reactance 
and capacitive reactance may create a phase shift between 
the voltage and current in an AC circuit. Whenever analyzing 
an AC circuit, it is very important to consider the resistance, 
inductive reactance, and the capacitive reactance. All three 
have an effect on the current of that circuit. 

Resistance
As mentioned, resistance creates an opposition to current 
in an AC circuit similar to the resistance of a DC circuit. 
The current through a resistive portion of an AC circuit 
is inversely proportional to the resistance and directly 
proportional to the voltage applied to that circuit or portion 
of the circuit. The equations I = E / R & E = I × R show how 
current is related to both voltage and resistance. It should be 
noted that resistance in an AC circuit does not create a phase 
shift between voltage and current. 

Figure 9-17 shows how a circuit of 10 ohms allows 11.5 amps 
of current flow through an AC resistive circuit of 115 volts.

Inductive Reactance
When moving a magnet through a coil of wire, a voltage is 
induced across the coil. If a complete circuit is provided, then 
a current will also be induced. The amount of induced voltage 
is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic 
field with respect to the coil. Conversely, current flowing 
through a coil of wire produces a magnetic field. When this 
wire is formed into a coil, it then becomes a basic inductor.

The primary effect of a coil is its property to oppose 
any change in current through it. This property is called 
inductance. When current flows through any conductor, a 
magnetic field starts to expand from the center of the wire. 
As the lines of magnetic force grow outward through the 
conductor, they induce an EMF in the conductor itself. 
The induced voltage is always in the direction opposite 
to the direction of the applied current flow. The effects 
of this countering EMF are to oppose the applied current. 
This effect is only a temporary condition. Once the current 
reaches a steady value in the conductor, the lines of magnetic 
force are no longer expanding and the countering EMF 
is no longer present. Since AC is constantly changing in 
value, the inductance repeats in a cycle always opposite the 
applied voltage. It should be noted that the unit of measure 
for inductance is the henry (H). 

The physical factors that affect inductance are:

1. Number of turns—doubling the number of turns in a 
coil produces a field twice as strong if the same current 
is used. As a general rule, the inductance varies with 
the square of the number of turns. 

2. Cross-sectional area of the coil—the inductance of a 
coil increases directly as the cross-sectional area of the 
core increases. Doubling the radius of a coil increases 
the inductance by a factor of four. 

3. Length of a coil—doubling the length of a coil, while 
keeping the same number of turns, reduces inductance 
by one-half.

4. Core material around which the coil is formed— 
coils are wound on either magnetic or nonmagnetic 
materials. Some nonmagnetic materials include 
air, copper, plastic, and glass. Magnetic materials 
include nickel, iron, steel, and cobalt, which have 
a permeability that provides a better path for the 
magnetic lines of force and permit a stronger  
magnetic field. 

Since AC is in a constant state of change, the magnetic fields 
within an inductor are also continuously changing and create 
an inducted voltage/current. This induced voltage opposes 
the applied voltage and is known as the counter EMF. This 
opposition is called inductive reactance, symbolized by XL, 
and is measured in ohms. This characteristic of the inductor 
may also create a phase shift between voltage and current 
of the circuit. The phase shift created by inductive reactance 
always causes voltage to lead current. That is, the voltage of 
an inductive circuit reaches its peak values before the current 
reaches peak values. Additional discussions related to phase 
shift are presented later in this chapter. 

Inductance is the property of a circuit to oppose any change 
in current and is measured in henries. Inductive reactance is 
a measure of how much the countering EMF in the circuit 
opposes the applied current. The inductive reactance of 
a component is directly proportional to the inductance of 
the component and the applied frequency to the circuit. By 
increasing either the inductance or applied frequency, the 
inductive reactance likewise increases and presents more 
opposition to current in the circuit. This relationship is given 
as XL = 2πfL Where XL = inductive reactance in ohms, L 
= inductance in henries, f = frequency in cycles per second, 
and π = 3.1416

In Figure 9-18, an AC series circuit is shown in which the 
inductance is 0.146 henry and the voltage is 110 volts at a 
frequency of 60 cycles per second. Inductive reactance is 
determined by the following method. 

XL = 2π × f × L

XL = 6.28 × 60 × 0.146

XL = 55Ω

In AC series circuits, inductive reactance is added like 
resistances in series in a DC circuit. [Figure 9-19] The total 
reactance in the illustrated circuit equals the sum of the 
individual reactances. 

XL = XL1 + XL2

XL =10Ω + 15Ω

XLT = 25Ω

The total reactance of inductors connected in parallel is 
found the same way as the total resistance in a parallel 
circuit. [Figure 9-20] Thus, the total reactance of inductances 
connected in parallel, as shown, is expressed as:

XLT  =

Capacitive Reactance
Capacitance is the ability of a body to hold an electric charge. 
In general, a capacitor is constructed of two parallel plates 
separated by an insulator. The insulator is commonly called 
the dielectric. The capacitor’s plates have the ability to store 
electrons when charged by a voltage source. The capacitor 
discharges when the applied voltage is no longer present and 
the capacitor is connected to a current path. In an electrical 
circuit, a capacitor serves as a reservoir or storehouse  
for electricity. 

The basic unit of capacitance is the farad and is given by the 
letter F. By definition, one farad is one coulomb of charge 
stored with one volt across the plates of the capacitor. In 
practical terms, one farad is a large amount of capacitance. 
Typically, in electronics, much smaller units are used. The two 
more common smaller units are the microfarad (μF), which is 
10-6 farad and the picofarad (pF), which is 10-12 farad.

Capacitance is a function of the physical properties of the 
capacitor: 

1. The capacitance of parallel plates is directly 
proportional to their area. A larger plate area produces 
a larger capacitance, and a smaller area produces less 
capacitance. If we double the area of the plates, there 
is room for twice as much charge.

2. The capacitance of parallel plates is inversely 
proportional to the distance between the plates. 

3. The dielectric material effects the capacitance of 
parallel plates. The dielectric constant of a vacuum is 
defined as 1, and that of air is very close to 1. These 
values are used as a reference, and all other materials 
have values relative to that of air (vacuum).

When an AC is applied in the circuit, the charge on the plates 
constantly changes. [Figure 9-21] This means that electricity 
must flow first from Y clockwise around to X, then from 
X counterclockwise around to Y, then from Y clockwise 
around to X, and so on. Although no current flows through 

the insulator between the plates of the capacitor, it constantly 
flows in the remainder of the circuit between X and Y. As this 
current alternates to and from the capacitor, a certain time lag 
is created. When a capacitor charges or discharges through 
a resistance, a certain amount of time is required for a full 
charge or discharge. The voltage across the capacitor does not 
change instantaneously. The rate of charging or discharging 
is determined by the time constant of the circuit. This rate of 
charge and discharge creates an opposition to current flow 
in AC circuits known as capacitive reactance. Capacitive 
reactance is symbolized by XC and is measured in ohms. 
This characteristic of a capacitor may also create a phase shift 
between voltage and current of the circuit. The phase shift 
created by capacitive reactance always causes current to lead 
voltage. That is, the current of a capacitive circuit reaches its 
peak values before the voltage reaches peak values.

Capacitive reactance is a measure of how much the capacitive 
circuit opposes the applied current flow. Capacitive reactance 
is measured in ohms. The capacitive reactance of a circuit is 
indirectly proportional to the capacitance of the circuit and 
the applied frequency to the circuit. By increasing either the 
capacitance or applied frequency, the capacitive reactance 
decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is given as:

XC =
      1

           2πfC

Where: XC = capacitive reactance in ohms, C = capacitance 
in farads, f = frequency in cycles per second, and π = 3.1416.

In Figure 9-21, a series circuit is shown in which the applied 
voltage is 110 volts at 400 cps, and the capacitance of a 
condenser is 80 mf. Find the capacitive reactance and the 
current flow.

Figure 9-22. Ohm's Law applies to AC circuit only when circuit 
consists of resistance only. Impedance (Z) = Resistance (R).

Figure 9-23. Two resistance values in parallel connected to an AC 
voltage. Impedance is equal to the total resistance of the circuit.

First, the capacitance, 80 μf, is changed to farads by dividing 
80 by 1,000,000, since 1 million microfarads is equal to 1 
farad. This quotient equals 0.000080 farad. This is substituted 
in the equation:

XC =
      1

           2πfC

XC =
            1

           2π(400)(0.000080)

XC = 4.97Ω
 
Impedance 
The total opposition to current flow in an AC circuit is known 
as impedance and is represented by the letter Z. The combined 
effects of resistance, inductive reactance, and capacitive 
reactance make up impedance (the total opposition to current 
flow in an AC circuit). In order to accurately calculate 
voltage and current in AC circuits, the effect of inductance 
and capacitance along with resistance must be considered. 
Impedance is measured in ohms. 

The rules and equations for DC circuits apply to AC circuits 
only when that circuit contains resistance alone and no 
inductance or capacitance. In both series and parallel circuits, 
if an AC circuit consists of resistance only, the value of the 
impedance is the same as the resistance, and Ohm’s Law 
for an AC circuit, I = E/Z, is exactly the same as for a DC 
circuit. Figure 9-22 illustrates a series circuit containing a 
heater element with 11 ohms resistance connected across a 
110-volt source. To find how much current flows if 110 volts 
AC is applied, the following example is solved:  

I = E
 Z

I =  110V
  11Ω

I = 10 amps

If there are two resistance values in parallel connected to an 
AC voltage, as seen in Figure 9-23, impedance is equal to 
the total resistance of the circuit. Once again, the calculations 
would be handled the same as if it were a DC circuit and the 
following would apply: 

RT  =
           1

    1     +     1
   R1  R2

RT  =
           1

    1     +     1
   20  20

RT = 10Ω

Since this is a pure resistive circuit RT = Z (Resistance = 
Impedance)

ZT = RT

ZT = 10Ω

To determine the current flow in the circuit use the equation: 

I = E
 Z
 

I =  50V
  10Ω

I = 5 amps

Impedance is the total opposition to current flow in an AC 
circuit. If a circuit has inductance or capacitance, one must take 
into consideration resistance (R), inductive reactance (XL), 
and/or capacitive reactance (XC) to determine impedance (Z). 
In this case, Z does not equal RT. Resistance and reactance 
(inductive or capacitive) cannot be added directly, but they

Figure 9-24. Impedance triangle.

Figure 9-25. A circuit containing resistance and inductance.

can be considered as two forces acting at right angles to each 
other. Thus, the relation between resistance, reactance, and 
impedance may be illustrated by a right triangle. [Figure 9-24] 
Since these quantities may be related to the sides of a right 
triangle, the formula for finding the impedance can be found 
using the Pythagorean Theorem. It states that the square of 
the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other 
two sides. Thus, the value of any side of a right triangle can 
be found if the other two sides are known. 

In practical terms, if a series AC circuit contains resistance 
and inductance, as shown in Figure 9-25, the relation between 
the sides can be stated as:

Z2 = R2 + (XL – XC)
2

The square root of both sides of the equation gives:

Z = √ R2 + (XL – XC)2 
 
This formula can be used to determine the impedance when 
the values of inductive reactance and resistance are known. It 
can be modified to solve for impedance in circuits containing 
capacitive reactance and resistance by substituting XC in the 
formula in place of XL. In circuits containing resistance with 
both inductive and capacitive reactance, the reactances can be 
combined; but because their effects in the circuit are exactly 
opposite, they are combined by subtraction (the smaller 
number is always subtracted from the larger): 

Z = XL – XC

or 

X = XC – XL

Figure 9-25 shows example 1. Here, a series circuit 
containing a resistor and an inductor are connected to a source 
of 110 volts at 60 cycles per second. The resistive element is 
a simple measuring 6 ohms, and the inductive element is a  

coil with an inductance of 0.021 henry. What is the value of 
the impedance and the current through the circuit? 

Solution:
First, the inductive reactance of the coil is computed: 

 XL = 2π × f × L

XL = 6.28 × 60 × 0.021

XL = 8 ohms inductive reactance

Next, the total impedance is computed:

Z = √ R2 + X2L 
 
Z = √ 62 + 82
 
Z = √ 36 + 64 
 
Z = √ 100
 
Z = 10Ω

Remember when making calculations for Z always use 
inductive reactance not inductance, and use capacitive 
reactance, not capacitance.

Once impedance is found, the total current can be calculated. 

I = E

I =  110V

Since this circuit is resistive and inductive, there is a phase 
shift where voltage leads current.

of 200 μf is connected in series with a 10 ohm resistor. 
[Figure 9-26] What is the value of the impedance, the current 
flow, and the voltage drop across the resistor? 

Solution:
First, the capacitance is changed from microfarads to farads. 
Since 1 million microfarads equal 1 farad, then 200 μf = 
0.000200 farads.

Next solve for capacitive reactance:

XC =  
  1

         2πfC

XC =  
        1

To find the impedance,

Z = √ R2 + X2C 

 
Z = √ 102 + 132
 
Z = 16.4Ω

Since this circuit is resistive and capacitive, there is a phase 
shift where current leads voltage:

To find the current:

IT =
 E

 Z

IT =
  110V

      6.4Ω

IT = 6.7 amps

To find the voltage drop across the resistor (ER):

ER = I × R

ER = 6.7A × 10Ω

ER = 67 volts

To find the voltage drop over the capacitor (EC):

EC = I × XC

EC = 6.7A × 13Ω

EC = 86.1 volts

The sum of these two voltages does not equal the applied 
voltage, since the current leads the voltage. Use the following 
formula to find the applied voltage:

E = √ (ER)2 + (EC)2

E = √ 672 + 86.12

E = √ 4,489 + 7,413

E = √ 11,902

E = 110 volts

Example 3: What is the impedance of a series circuit 
consisting of a capacitor with a capacitive reactance of 7 
ohms, an inductor with an inductive reactance of 10 ohms, 
and a resistor with a resistance of 4 ohms? [Figure 9-27]

Solution:

Z = √ R2 + (XL – XC)2

Z = √ 42 + (10 – 7)2

Z = √ 25

Z = 5Ω

Remember that inductive and capacitive reactances can cause 
a phase shift between voltage and current. In this example, 
inductive reactance is larger than capacitive reactance, so the 
voltage leads current. 

It should be noted that since inductive reactance, capacitive 
reactance, and resistance affect each other at right angles, 
the voltage drops of any series AC circuit should be added 
using vector addition. Figure 9-28 shows the voltage drops 
over the series AC circuit described in example 3 above. 

To calculate the individual voltage drops, simply use the 
equations:  

ER = I × R

EXL = I × XL

EXC = I × XC

To determine the total applied voltage for the circuit, each 
individual voltage drop must be added using vector addition. 

ET = √ ER2  + (EL – EC)2

ET = √ 882+ (220 – 154)2

ET = √ 882+ 662

ET = √12,100

ET = 110 volts

Parallel AC Circuits
When solving parallel AC circuits, one must also use a 
derivative of the Pythagorean Theorem. The equation for 
finding impedance in an AC circuit is as follows:

Z =        1  2 +    1    –   1   2                R               XL      XC  
To determine the total impedance of the parallel circuit shown 
in Figure 9-29, one would first determine the capacitive and 
inductive reactances. (Remember to convert microfarads  
to farads.)

Power in AC Circuits
Since voltage and current determine power, there are 
similarities in the power consumed by both AC and DC 
circuits. In AC however, current is a function of both the 
resistance and the reactance of the circuit. The power 
consumed by any AC circuit is a function of the applied 
voltage and both circuit’s resistance and reactance. AC 
circuits have two distinct types of power, one created by the 
resistance of the circuit and one created by the reactance of 
the circuit. 

True Power
True power of any AC circuit is commonly referred to as 
the working power of the circuit. True power is the power 
consumed by the resistance portion of the circuit and is 
measured in watts (W). True power is symbolized by the 
letter P and is indicated by any wattmeter in the circuit. True 
power is calculated by the formula: 

P = I2 × Z

Apparent Power 
Apparent power in an AC circuit is sometimes referred to as 
the reactive power of a circuit. Apparent power is the power 
consumed by the entire circuit, including both the resistance 
and the reactance. Apparent power is symbolized by the letter 
S and is measured in volt-amps (VA). Apparent power is a 
product of the effective voltage multiplied by the effective 
current. Apparent power is calculated by the formula: 

S = I2 × Z

Power Factor 
As seen in Figure 9-30, the resistive power and the reactive 
power effect the circuit at right angles to each other. The power 
factor in an AC circuit is created by this right angle effect.

Power factor can be defined as the mathematical difference 
between true power and apparent power. Power factor (PF)

is a ratio and always a measurement between 0 and 100. The 
power factor is directly related to the phase shift of a circuit. 
The greater the phase shift of a circuit the lower the power 
factor. For example, an AC circuit that is purely inductive 
(contains reactance only and no resistance) has a phase 
shift of 90° and a power factor of 0.0. An AC circuit that is 
purely resistive (has no reactance) has a phase shift of 0 and 
a power factor of 100. Power factor is calculated by using 
the following formula: 

PF =     True Power (Watts)    × 100
           Apparent Power (VA)
 
Example of calculating PF: Figure 9-31 shows an AC load 
connected to a 50 volt power supply. The current draw of 
the circuit is 5 amps and the total resistance of the circuit is 
8 ohms. Determine the true power, the apparent power, and 
the power factor for this circuit. 

Solution:

P = I2 × R

P = 52 × 8

P = 200 Watts

S = E × I

S = 50 × 5

S = 250VA

PF =     TP    × 100
            S

PF =     200    × 100
             250

PF = 80


9-21

Figure 9-32. Lead-acid battery installation.

Figure 9-33. Valve-regulated lead-acid battery (sealed battery). 

Power factor can also be represented as a percentage. Using 
a percentage to show power factor, the circuit in the previous 
example would have a power factor of 80 percent.

It should be noted that a low power factor is undesirable. 
Circuits with a lower power factor create excess load on 
the power supply and produce inefficiency in the system. 
Aircraft AC alternators must typically operate with a power 
factor between 90 percent and 100 percent. It is therefore very 
important to carefully consider power factor when designing 
the aircraft electrical system.
 
Aircraft Batteries
Aircraft batteries are used for many functions (e.g., ground 
power, emergency power, improving DC bus stability, 
and fault clearing). Most small private aircraft use lead-
acid batteries. Most commercial and corporate aircraft use 
nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries. However, other lead 
acid types of batteries are becoming available, such as the 
valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries. The battery best 
suited for a particular application depends on the relative 
importance of several characteristics, such as weight, cost, 
volume, service or shelf life, discharge rate, maintenance, 
and charging rate. Any change of battery type may be 
considered a major alteration.

Types of Batteries
Aircraft batteries are usually identified by the material used 
for the plates. The two most common types of battery used 
are lead-acid and NiCd batteries.

Lead-Acid Batteries
Dry Charged Cell Lead-Acid Batteries

Dry charged cell lead-acid batteries, also known as flooded 
or wet batteries, are assembled with electrodes (plates) that 
have been fully charged and dried. The electrolyte is added 
to the battery when it is placed in service, and battery life 
begins when the electrolyte is added. An aircraft storage 
battery consists of 6 or 12 lead-acid cells connected in series. 
The open circuit voltage of the 6 cell battery is approximately 
12 volts, and the open circuit voltage of the 12-cell battery is 
approximately 24 volts. Open circuit voltage is the voltage of 
the battery when it is not connected to a load. When flooded 
(vented) batteries are on charge, the oxygen generated at 
the positive plates escapes from the cell. Concurrently, at 
the negative plates, hydrogen is generated from water and 
escapes from the cell. The overall result is the gassing of the 
cells and water loss. Therefore, flooded cells require periodic 
water replenishment. [Figure 9-32]

Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid Batteries (VRLA)

VRLA batteries contain all electrolyte absorbed in glass-mat 
separators with no free electrolyte and are sometimes referred 
to as sealed batteries. [Figure 9-33] The electrochemical 
reactions for VRLA batteries are the same as flooded 
batteries, except for the gas recombination mechanism that 
is predominant in VRLA batteries. These types of battery 
are used in general aviation and turbine powered aircraft and 
are sometimes authorized replacements for NiCd batteries.

When VRLA batteries are on charge, oxygen combines 
chemically with the lead at the negative plates in the presence 
of H2SO4 to form lead sulfate and water. This oxygen 
recombination suppresses the generation of hydrogen at 
the negative plates. Overall, there is no water loss during 
charging. A very small quantity of water may be lost as a 
result of self-discharge reactions; however, such loss is so 
small that no provisions are made for water replenishment. 
The battery cells have a pressure relief safety valve that may 
vent if the battery is overcharged. 


9-22

Figure 9-34. NiCd battery installation. 
Figure 9-35. Thermal runaway damage.

NiCd Batteries
A NiCd battery consists of a metallic box, usually stainless 
steel, plastic-coated steel, painted steel, or titanium 
containing a number of individual cells. [Figure 9-34] These 
cells are connected in series to obtain 12 volts or 24 volts. 
The cells are connected by highly conductive nickel copper 
links. Inside the battery box, the cells are held in place by 
partitions, liners, spacers, and a cover assembly. The battery 
has a ventilation system to allow the escape of the gases 
produced during an overcharge condition and provide cooling 
during normal operation.

NiCd cells installed in an aircraft battery are typical of 
the vented cell type. The vented cells have a vent or low 
pressure release valve that releases any generated oxygen 
and hydrogen gases when overcharged or discharged rapidly. 
This also means the battery is not normally damaged by 
excessive rates of overcharge, discharge, or even negative 
charge. The cells are rechargeable and deliver a voltage of 
1.2 volts during discharge.

Aircraft that are outfitted with NiCd batteries typically 
have a fault protection system that monitors the condition 
of the battery. The battery charger is the unit that monitors 
the condition of the battery and the following conditions  
are monitored.

1. Overheat condition

2. Low temperature condition (below –40 °F)

3. Cell imbalance

4. Open circuit

5. Shorted circuit

If the battery charger finds a fault, it turns off and sends a fault 
signal to the Electrical Load Management System (ELMS).

NiCd batteries are capable of performing to its rated capacity 
when the ambient temperature of the battery is in the range 
of approximately 60–90 °F. An increase or decrease in 
temperature from this range results in reduced capacity. NiCd 
batteries have a ventilation system to control the temperature 
of the battery. A combination of high battery temperature (in 
excess of 160 °F) and overcharging can lead to a condition 
called thermal runaway. [Figure 9-35] The temperature of 
the battery has to be constantly monitored to ensure safe 
operation. Thermal runaway can result in a NiCd chemical 
fire and/or explosion of the NiCd battery under recharge by a 
constant-voltage source and is due to cyclical, ever-increasing 
temperature and charging current. One or more shorted cells 
or an existing high temperature and low charge can produce 
the following cyclical sequence of events: 

1. Excessive current, 

2. Increased temperature, 

3. Decreased cell(s) resistance, 

4. Further increased current, and 

5. Further increased temperature. 

This does not become a self-sustaining thermal-chemical 
action if the constant-voltage charging source is removed 
before the battery temperature is in excess of 160 °F.

Capacity
Capacity is measured quantitatively in ampere-hours 
delivered at a specified discharge rate to a specified cut-off 
voltage at room temperature. The cut-off voltage is 1.0 volt 
per cell. Battery available capacity depends upon several 
factors including such items as:

1. Cell design (cell geometry, plate thickness, hardware, 
and terminal design govern performance under 
specific usage conditions of temperature, discharge 
rate, etc.).

Aircraft Battery Ratings by Specification
The one-hour rate is the rate of discharge a battery can endure 
for 1 hour with the battery voltage at or above 1.67 volts per 
cell, or 20 volts for a 24-volt lead-acid battery, or 10 volts for 
a 12-volt lead-acid battery. The one-hour capacity, measured 
in ampere hours (Ah), is the product of the discharge rate and 
time (in hours) to the specified end voltage. 

The emergency rate is the total essential load, measured in 
amperes, required to support the essential bus for 30 minutes. 
This is the rate of discharge a battery can endure for 30 
minutes with the battery voltage at or above 1.67 volts per 
cell, or 20 volts for a 24 volt lead-acid battery, or 10 volts 
for a 12 volt lead-acid battery.

Storing and Servicing Facilities
Separate facilities for storing and/or servicing flooded 
electrolyte lead-acid and NiCd batteries must be maintained. 
Introduction of acid electrolyte into alkaline electrolyte 
causes permanent damage to vented (flooded electrolyte) 
NiCd batteries and vice versa. However, batteries that are 
sealed can be charged and capacity checked in the same area. 
Because the electrolyte in a valve-regulated lead-acid battery 
is absorbed in the separators and porous plates, it cannot 
contaminate a NiCd battery even when they are serviced in 
the same area.

WARNING: It is extremely dangerous to store or service 
lead-acid and NiCd batteries in the same area. Introduction 
of acid electrolytes into alkaline electrolyte destroys the 
NiCd, and vice versa.

Battery Freezing
Discharged lead-acid batteries exposed to cold temperatures 
are subject to plate damage due to freezing of the electrolyte. 
To prevent freezing damage, maintain each cell’s specific 
gravity at 1.275 or, for sealed lead-acid batteries, check 
open circuit voltage. [Figure 9-36] NiCd battery electrolyte 
is not as susceptible to freezing because no appreciable 
chemical change takes place between the charged and 
discharged states. However, the electrolyte freezes at  
approximately –75 °F.
 

NOTE: Only a load check determines overall battery condition.

Temperature Correction
U.S.-manufactured lead-acid batteries are considered fully 
charged when the specific gravity reading is between 1.275 
and 1.300. A 1⁄3 discharged battery reads about 1.240 and 
a 2⁄3 discharged battery shows a specific gravity reading of 
about 1.200 when tested by a hydrometer at an electrolyte 
temperature of 80 °F. However, to determine precise specific 
gravity readings, a temperature correction should be applied 
to the hydrometer indication. [Figure 9-37] As an example, 
for a hydrometer reading of 1.260 and electrolyte temperature 
of 40 °F, the corrected specific gravity reading of the  
electrolyte is 1.244.


9-24

Battery Charging 
Operation of aircraft batteries beyond their ambient 
temperature or charging voltage limits can result in excessive 
cell temperatures leading to electrolyte boiling, rapid 
deterioration of the cells, and battery failure. The relationship 
between maximum charging voltage and the number of cells 
in the battery is also significant. This determines (for a given 
ambient temperature and state of charge) the rate at which 
energy is absorbed as heat within the battery. For lead-acid 
batteries, the voltage per cell must not exceed 2.35 volts. 
In the case of NiCd batteries, the charging voltage limit 
varies with design and construction. Values of 1.4 and 1.5 
volts per cell are generally used. In all cases, follow the 
recommendations of the battery manufacturer.

Constant Voltage Charging (CP)

The battery charging system in an airplane is of the constant 
voltage type. An engine-driven generator, capable of 
supplying the required voltage, is connected through the 
aircraft electrical system directly to the battery. A battery 
switch is incorporated in the system so that the battery may 
be disconnected when the airplane is not in operation.

The voltage of the generator is accurately controlled by means 
of a voltage regulator connected in the field circuit of the 
generator. For a 12-volt system, the voltage of the generator 
is adjusted to approximately 14.25. On 24-volt systems, 
the adjustment should be between 28 and 28.5 volts. When 
these conditions exist, the initial charging current through the 
battery is high. As the state of charge increases, the battery 
voltage also increases, causing the current to taper down. 
When the battery is fully charged, its voltage is almost equal 
to the generator voltage, and very little current flows into the 
battery. When the charging current is low, the battery may 
remain connected to the generator without damage.

When using a constant-voltage system in a battery shop, a 
voltage regulator that automatically maintains a constant 
voltage is incorporated in the system. A higher capacity 
battery (e.g., 42 Ah) has a lower resistance than a lower 
capacity battery (e.g., 33 Ah). Hence, a high-capacity battery 
draws a higher charging current than a low-capacity battery 
when both are in the same state of charge and when the 
charging voltages are equal. The constant voltage method is 
the preferred charging method for lead-acid batteries.

Constant Current Charging 

Constant current charging is the most convenient for charging 
batteries outside the airplane because several batteries 
of varying voltages may be charged at once on the same 
system. A constant current charging system usually consists 
of a rectifier to change the normal AC supply to DC. A 
transformer is used to reduce the available 110-volt or 220-

volt AC supply to the desired level before it is passed through 
the rectifier. If a constant current charging system is used, 
multiple batteries may be connected in series, provided that 
the charging current is kept at such a level that the battery 
does not overheat or gas excessively.

The constant current charging method is the preferred method 
for charging NiCd batteries. Typically, a NiCd battery is 
constant current charged at a rate of 1CA until all the cells 
have reached at least 1.55V. Another charge cycle follows at 
0.1CA, again until all cells have reached 1.55V. The charge 
is finished with an overcharge or top-up charge, typically for 
not less than 4 hours at a rate of 0.1CA. The purpose of the 
overcharge is to expel as much, if not all the gases collected 
on the electrodes, hydrogen on the anode, and oxygen on 
the cathode; some of these gases recombine to form water 
that, in turn, raises the electrolyte level to its highest level 
after which it is safe to adjust the electrolyte levels. During 
the overcharge or top-up charge, the cell voltages go beyond 
1.6V and then slowly start to drop. No cell should rise above 
1.71V (dry cell) or drop below 1.55V (gas barrier broken).

Charging is done with vent caps loosened or open. A stuck 
vent might increase the pressure in the cell. It also allows 
for refilling of water to correct levels before the end of the 
top-up charge while the charge current is still on. However, 
cells should be closed again as soon as the vents have been 
cleaned and checked since carbon dioxide dissolved from 
outside air carbonates the cells and ages the battery.

Battery Maintenance
Battery inspection and maintenance procedures vary with 
the type of chemical technology and the type of physical 
construction. Always follow the battery manufacturer’s 
approved procedures. Battery performance at any time in a 
given application depends upon the battery’s age, state of 
health, state of charge, and mechanical integrity, which you 
can determine according  to the following:

• To determine the life and age of the battery, record the 
install date of the battery on the battery. During normal 
battery maintenance, battery age must be documented 
either in the aircraft maintenance log or in the shop 
maintenance log.

• Lead-acid battery state of health may be determined 
by duration of service interval (in the case of vented 
batteries), by environmental factors (such as excessive 
heat or cold), and by observed electrolyte leakage (as 
evidenced by corrosion of wiring and connectors or 
accumulation of powdered salts). If the battery needs to 
be refilled often, with no evidence of external leakage, 
this may indicate a poor state of the battery, the battery 
charging system, or an overcharge condition.


9-25

Figure 9-38. Battery charger.

• Use a hydrometer to determine the specific gravity of 
the lead-acid battery electrolyte, which is the weight of 
the electrolyte compared to the weight of pure water. 
Take care to ensure the electrolyte is returned to the 
cell from which it was extracted. When a specific 
gravity difference of 0.050 or more exists between 
cells of a battery, the battery is approaching the end of 
its useful life and replacement should be considered. 
Electrolyte level may be adjusted by the addition of 
distilled water. Do not add electrolyte.

• Battery state of charge is determined by the cumulative 
effect of charging and discharging the battery. In 
a normal electrical charging system, the aircraft 
generator or alternator restores a battery to full charge 
during a flight of 1 hour to 90 minutes.

• Proper mechanical integrity involves the absence 
of any physical damage, as well as assurance that 
hardware is correctly installed and the battery is 
properly connected. Battery and battery compartment 
venting system tubes, nipples, and attachments, when 
required, provide a means of avoiding the potential 
buildup of explosive gases, and should be checked 
periodically to ensure that they are securely connected 
and oriented in accordance with the maintenance 
manual’s installation procedures. Always follow 
procedures approved for the specific aircraft and 
battery system to ensure that the battery system is 
capable of delivering specified performance.

Battery and Charger Characteristics
The following information is provided to acquaint the user 
with characteristics of the more common aircraft battery 
and battery charger types. [Figure 9-38] Products may 
vary from these descriptions due to different applications of 
available technology. Consult the manufacturer for specific 
performance data.

NOTE: Never connect a lead-acid battery to a charger, unless 
properly serviced.

Lead-Acid Batteries 

Lead-acid vented batteries have a two volt nominal cell 
voltage. Batteries are constructed so that individual cells 
cannot be removed. Occasional addition of water is required 
to replace water loss due to overcharging in normal service. 
Batteries that become fully discharged may not accept 
recharge. Lead-acid sealed batteries are similar in most 
respects to lead-acid vented batteries, but do not require the 
addition of water.

The lead-acid battery is economical and has extensive 
application but is heavier than an equivalent performance 
battery of another type. The battery is capable of a high rate 
of discharge and low-temperature performance. However, 
maintaining a high rate of discharge for a period of time 
usually warps the cell plates, shorting out the battery. Its 
electrolyte has a moderate specific gravity, and state of charge 
can be checked with a hydrometer.

Lead-acid batteries are usually charged by regulated DC 
voltage sources. This allows maximum accumulation of 
charge in the early part of recharging.

NiCd Batteries

NiCd vented batteries have a 1.2-volt nominal cell voltage. 
Occasional addition of distilled water is required to replace 
water loss due to overcharging in normal service. Cause 
of failure is usually shorting or weakening of a cell. After 
replacing the bad cell with a good cell, the battery’s life can 
be extended for 5 or more years. Full discharge is not harmful 
to this type of battery.

NiCd sealed batteries are similar in most respects to NiCd 
vented batteries, but do not normally require the addition of 
water. Fully discharging the battery (to zero volts) may cause 
irreversible damage to one or more cells, leading to eventual 
battery failure due to low capacity.

The state of charge of a NiCd battery cannot be determined 
by measuring the specific gravity of the potassium hydroxide 
electrolyte. The electrolyte specific gravity does not change 
with the state of charge. The only accurate way to determine 
the state of charge of a NiCd battery is by a measured 
discharge with a NiCd battery charger and following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. After the battery has been 
fully charged and allowed to stand for at least 2 hours, the 
fluid level may be adjusted, if necessary, using distilled or 
demineralized water. Because the fluid level varies with the 


9-26

state of charge, water should never be added while the battery 
is installed in the aircraft. Overfilling the battery results in 
electrolyte spewage during charging. This causes corrosive 
effects on the cell links, self-discharge of the battery, dilution 
of the electrolyte density, possible blockage of the cell vents, 
and eventual cell rupture.

Constant current battery chargers are usually provided for 
NiCd batteries because the NiCd cell voltage has a negative 
temperature coefficient. With a constant voltage charging 
source, a NiCd battery having a shorted cell might overheat 
due to excessive overcharge and undergo a thermal runaway, 
destroying the battery and creating a possible safety hazard 
to the aircraft. Pulsed-current battery chargers are sometimes 
provided for NiCd batteries.

CAUTION: It is important to use the proper charging 
procedures for batteries under test and maintenance. These 
charging regimes for reconditioning and charging cycles 
are defined by the aircraft manufacturer and should be  
closely followed.

Aircraft Battery Inspection
Aircraft battery inspection consists of the following items:

1. Inspect battery sump jar and lines for condition and 
security.

2. Inspect battery terminals and quickly disconnect plugs 
and pins for evidence of corrosion, pitting, arcing, and 
burns. Clean as required.

3. Inspect battery drain and vent lines for restriction, 
deterioration, and security.

4. Routine preflight and postflight inspection procedures 
should include observation for evidence of physical 
damage, loose connections, and electrolyte loss.

Ventilation Systems
Modern airplanes are equipped with battery ventilating 
systems. The ventilating system removes gasses and acid 
fumes from the battery in order to reduce fire hazards and 
to eliminate damage to airframe parts. Air is carried from a 
scoop outside the airplane through a vent tube to the interior 
of the battery case. After passing over the top of the battery, 
air, battery gasses, and acid fumes are carried through another 
tube to the battery sump. This sump is a glass or plastic jar 
of at least one pint capacity. In the jar is a felt pad about 1 
inch thick saturated with a 5-percent solution of bicarbonate 
of soda and water. The tube carrying fumes to the sump 
extends into the jar to within about 1⁄4 inch of the felt pad. 
An overboard discharge tube leads from the top of the sump 
jar to a point outside the airplane. The outlet for this tube is 
designed so there is negative pressure on the tube whenever 

the airplane is in flight. This helps to ensure a continuous 
flow of air across the top of the battery through the sump 
and outside the airplane. The acid fumes going into the 
sump are neutralized by the action of the soda solution, thus 
preventing corrosion of the aircraft’s metal skin or damage 
to a fabric surface.

Installation Practices

• External surface—Clean the external surface of the 
battery prior to installation in the aircraft.

• Replacing lead-acid batteries—When replacing 
lead-acid batteries with NiCd batteries, a battery 
temperature or current monitoring system must be 
installed. Neutralize the battery box or compartment 
and thoroughly flush with water and dry. A flight 
manual supplement must also be provided for the NiCd 
battery installation. Acid residue can be detrimental to 
the proper functioning of a NiCd battery, as alkaline 
is to a lead-acid battery.

• Battery venting—Battery fumes and gases may cause 
an explosive mixture or contaminated compartments 
and should be dispersed by adequate ventilation. 
Venting systems often use ram pressure to flush 
fresh air through the battery case or enclosure to a 
safe overboard discharge point. The venting system 
pressure differential should always be positive 
and remain between recommended minimum and 
maximum values. Line runs should not permit battery 
overflow fluids or condensation to be trapped and 
prevent free airflow.

• Battery sump jars—A battery sump jar installation 
may be incorporated in the venting system to dispose 
of battery electrolyte overflow. The sump jar should 
be of adequate design and the proper neutralizing 
agent used. The sump jar must be located only on the 
discharge side of the battery venting system. 

• Installing batteries—When installing batteries in an 
aircraft, exercise care to prevent inadvertent shorting 
of the battery terminals. Serious damage to the aircraft 
structure (frame, skin and other subsystems, avionics, 
wire, fuel, etc.) can be sustained by the resultant high 
discharge of electrical energy. This condition may 
normally be avoided by insulating the terminal posts 
during the installation process. Remove the grounding 
lead first for battery removal, then the positive lead. 
Connect the grounding lead of the battery last to 
minimize the risk of shorting the hot terminal of the 
battery during installation.

• Battery hold down devices—Ensure that the battery 
hold down devices are secure, but not so tight as to 


9-27

exert excessive pressure that may cause the battery to 
buckle causing internal shorting of the battery.

• Quick-disconnect type battery—If a quick-disconnect 
type of battery connector that prohibits crossing the 
battery lead is not employed, ensure that the aircraft 
wiring is connected to the proper battery terminal. 
Reverse polarity in an electrical system can seriously 
damage a battery and other electrical components. 
Ensure that the battery cable connections are tight to 
prevent arcing or a high resistance connection.

Troubleshooting
See Figure 9-39 for a troubleshooting chart.

DC Generators and Controls 
DC generators transform mechanical energy into electrical 
energy. As the name implies, DC generators produce direct 
current and are typically found on light aircraft. In many 
cases, DC generators have been replaced with DC alternators. 
Both devices produce electrical energy to power the aircraft’s 
electrical loads and charge the aircraft’s battery. Even though 
they share the same purpose, the DC alternator and DC 
generator are very different. DC generators require a control 
circuit in order to ensure the generator maintains the correct 
voltage and current for the current electrical conditions of 
the aircraft. Typically, aircraft generators maintain a nominal 
output voltage of approximately 14 volts or 28 volts.

Generators
The principles of electromagnetic induction were discussed 
earlier in this chapter. These principles show that voltage is 
induced in the armature of a generator throughout the entire 
360° rotation of the conductor. The armature is the rotating 
portion of a DC generator. As shown, the voltage being 
induced is AC. [Figure 9-40]

Since the conductor loop is constantly rotating, some means 
must be provided to connect this loop of wire to the electrical 
loads. As shown in Figure 9-41, slip rings and brushes can 
be used to transfer the electrical energy from the rotating 
loop to the stationary aircraft loads. The slip rings are 
connected to the loop and rotate; the brushes are stationary 
and allow a current path to the electrical loads. The slip 
rings are typically a copper material and the brushes are a 
soft carbon substance. 

It is important to remember that the voltage being produced 
by this basic generator is AC, and AC voltage is supplied 
to the slip rings. Since the goal is to supply DC loads, some 
means must be provided to change the AC voltage to a DC 
voltage. Generators use a modified slip ring arrangement, 
known as a commutator, to change the AC produced in 

the generator loop into a DC voltage. The action of the 
commutator allows the generator to produce a DC output.

By replacing the slip rings of the basic AC generator with 
two half cylinders (the commutator), a basic DC generator is 
obtained. In Figure 9-42, the red side of the coil is connected 
to the red segment and the amber side of the coil to the amber 
segment. The segments are insulated from each other. The 
two stationary brushes are placed on opposite sides of the 
commutator and are so mounted that each brush contacts 
each segment of the commutator as the commutator revolves 
simultaneously with the loop. The rotating parts of a DC 
generator (coil and commutator) are called an armature.

As seen in the very simple generator of Figure 9-42, as the 
loop rotates the brushes make contact with different segments 
of the commutator. In positions A, C, and E, the brushes touch 
the insulation between the brushes; when the loop is in these 
positions, no voltage is being produced. In position B, the 
positive brush touches the red side of the conductor loop. In 
position D, the positive brush touches the amber side of the 
armature conductor. This type of connection reversal changes 
the AC produced in the conductor coil into DC to power the 
aircraft. An actual DC generator is more complex, having 
several loops of wire and commutator segments. 

Because of this switching of commutator elements, the 
red brush is always in contact with the coil side moving 
downward, and the amber brush is always in contact with 
the coil side moving upward. Though the current actually 
reverses its direction in the loop in exactly the same way as 
in the AC generator, commutator action causes the current 
to flow always in the same direction through the external 
circuit or meter. 

The voltage generated by the basic DC generator in 
Figure 9-42 varies from zero to its maximum value twice 
for each revolution of the loop. This variation of DC voltage 
is called ripple and may be reduced by using more loops, or 
coils, as shown in Figure 9-43. 
 
As the number of loops is increased, the variation between 
maximum and minimum values of voltage is reduced 
[Figure 9-43], and the output voltage of the generator 
approaches a steady DC value. For each additional loop in 
the rotor, another two commutator segments is required. A 
photo of a typical DC generator commutator is shown in 
Figure 9-44.

Construction Features of DC Generators
The major parts, or assemblies, of a DC generator are a field 
frame, a rotating armature, and a brush assembly. The parts 
of a typical aircraft generator are shown in Figure 9-45.

Field Frame

The frame has two functions: to hold the windings needed to 
produce a magnetic field, and to act as a mechanical support 
for the other parts of the generator. The actual electromagnet 
conductor is wrapped around pieces of laminated metal called 
field poles. The poles are typically bolted to the inside of the 

frame and laminated to reduce eddy current losses and serve  
the same purpose as the iron core of an electromagnet; they 
concentrate the lines of force produced by the field coils. 
The field coils are made up of many turns of insulated wire 
and are usually wound on a form that fits over the iron core 
of the pole to which it is securely fastened. [Figure 9-46]

A DC current is fed to the field coils to produce an 
electromagnetic field. This current is typically obtained 
from an external source that provides voltage and current 
regulation for the generator system. Generator control 
systems are discussed later in this chapter. 

Armature

The armature assembly of a generator consists of two primary 
elements: the wire coils (called windings) wound around 
an iron core and the commutator assembly. The armature 
windings are evenly spaced around the armature and mounted 
on a steel shaft. The armature rotates inside the magnetic field 
produced by the field coils. The core of the armature acts as 
an iron conductor in the magnetic field and, for this reason, 
is laminated to prevent the circulation of eddy currents. A 
typical armature assembly is shown in Figure 9-47.

Commutators

Figure 9-48 shows a cross-sectional view of a typical 
commutator. The commutator is located at the end of an 
armature and consists of copper segments divided by a thin 
insulator. The insulator is often made from the mineral mica. 
The brushes ride on the surface of the commutator forming the 
electrical contact between the armature coils and the external 
circuit. A flexible, braided copper conductor, commonly 
called a pigtail, connects each brush to the external circuit. The 
brushes are free to slide up and down in their holders in order 
to follow any irregularities in the surface of the commutator. 
The constant making and breaking of electrical connections 

between the brushes and the commutator segments, along with 
the friction between the commutator and the brush, causes 
brushes to wear out and need regular attention or replacement. 
For these reasons, the material commonly used for brushes is 
high-grade carbon. The carbon must be soft enough to prevent 
undue wear of the commutator and yet hard enough to provide 
reasonable brush life. Since the contact resistance of carbon is 
fairly high, the brush must be quite large to provide a current 
path for the armature windings.

The commutator surface is highly polished to reduce friction 
as much as possible. Oil or grease must never be used on a

it to avoid marring or scratching the surface. 

Types of DC Generators
There are three types of DC generators: series wound, 
parallel (shunt) wound, and series-parallel (or compound 
wound). The appropriate generator is determined by the 
connections to the armature and field circuits with respect to 
the external circuit. The external circuit is the electrical load 
powered by the generator. In general, the external circuit is 
used for charging the aircraft battery and supplying power to 
all electrical equipment being used by the aircraft. As their 
names imply, windings in series have characteristics different 
from windings in parallel. 

Series Wound DC Generators

The series generator contains a field winding connected 
in series with the external circuit. [Figure 9-49] Series 
generators have very poor voltage regulation under changing 
load, since the greater the current is through the field coils 
to the external circuit, the greater the induced EMFs and the 
greater the output voltage is. When the aircraft electrical 
load is increased, the voltage increases; when the load is 
decreased, the voltage decreases. 

Since the series wound generator has such poor voltage 
and current regulation, it is never employed as an airplane 
generator. Generators in airplanes have field windings, that 
are connected either in shunt or in compound formats.

Parallel (Shunt) Wound DC Generators

A generator having a field winding connected in parallel with 
the external circuit is called a shunt generator. [Figure 9-50] 
It should be noted that, in electrical terms, shunt means  

parallel. Therefore, this type of generator could be called 
either a shunt generator or a parallel generator.

In a shunt generator, any increase in load causes a decrease 
in the output voltage, and any decrease in load causes an 
increase output voltage. This occurs since the field winding 
is connected in parallel to the load and armature, and all the 
current flowing in the external circuit passes only through 
the armature winding (not the field). 

As shown in Figure 9-50A, the output voltage of a shunt 
generator can be controlled by means of a rheostat inserted 
in series with the field windings. As the resistance of the field 
circuit is increased, the field current is reduced; consequently, 
the generated voltage is also reduced. As the field resistance 
is decreased, the field current increases and the generator 
output increases. In the actual aircraft, the field rheostat 
would be replaced with an automatic control device, such 
as a voltage regulator. 

Compound Wound DC Generators

A compound wound generator employs two field windings one 
in series and another in parallel with the load. [Figure 9-51]
This arrangement takes advantage of both the series and

parallel characteristics described earlier. The output of a 
compound wound generator is relatively constant, even with 
changes in the load.

Generator Ratings
A DC generator is typically rated for its voltage and power 
output. Each generator is designed to operate at a specified 
voltage, approximately 14 or 28 volts. It should be noted that 
aircraft electrical systems are designed to operate at one of 
these two voltage values. The aircraft’s voltage depends on 
which battery is selected for that aircraft. Batteries are either 
12 or 24 volts when fully charged. The generator selected 
must have a voltage output slightly higher than the battery 
voltage. Hence, the 14-or 28-volt rating is required for aircraft 
DC generators.

The power output of any generator is given as the maximum 
number of amperes the generator can safely supply. Generator 
rating and performance data are stamped on the nameplate 
attached to the generator. When replacing a generator, it is 
important to choose one of the proper ratings. 

The rotation of generators is termed either clockwise or 
counterclockwise, as viewed from the driven end. The 
direction of rotation may also be stamped on the data plate. It 
is important that a generator with the correct rotation be used; 

otherwise, the polarity of the output voltage is reversed. The 
speed of an aircraft engine varies from idle rpm to takeoff 
rpm; however, during the major portion of a flight, it is at a 
constant cruising speed. The generator drive is usually geared 
to turn the generator between 11⁄8 and 11⁄2 times the engine 
crankshaft speed. Most aircraft generators have a speed at 
which they begin to produce their normal voltage. Called the 
“coming in” speed, it is usually about 1,500 rpm. 

DC Generator Maintenance
The following information about the inspection and 
maintenance of DC generator systems is general in nature 
because of the large number of differing aircraft generator 
systems. These procedures are for familiarization only. 
Always follow the applicable manufacturer’s instructions 
for a given generator system. In general, the inspection of 
the generator installed in the aircraft should include the 
following items: 

1. Security of generator mounting.

2. Condition of electrical connections.

3. Dirt and oil in the generator. If oil is present, check 
engine oil seals. Blow out any dirt with compressed air.

4. Condition of generator brushes.

5. Generator operation.

6. Voltage regulator operation.

Sparking of brushes quickly reduces the effective brush area 
in contact with the commutator bars. The degree of such 
sparking should be determined. Excessive wear warrants 
a detailed inspection and possible replacement of various 
components. [Figure 9-52]

Manufacturers usually recommend the following procedures 
to seat brushes that do not make good contact with slip 
rings or commutators. Lift the brush sufficiently to permit

the insertion of a strip of extra-fine 000 (triple aught) grit, 
or finer, sandpaper under the brush, rough side towards the 
carbon brush. [Figure 9-53]

Pull the sandpaper in the direction of armature rotation, being 
careful to keep the ends of the sandpaper as close to the slip 
ring or commutator surface as possible in order to avoid 
rounding the edges of the brush. When pulling the sandpaper 
back to the starting point, raise the brush so it does not ride 
on the sandpaper. Sand the brush only in the direction of 
rotation. Carbon dust resulting from brush sanding should 
be thoroughly cleaned from all parts of the generators after 
a sanding operation.

After the generator has run for a short period, brushes should 
be inspected to make sure that pieces of sand have not become 
embedded in the brush. Under no circumstances should 
emery cloth or similar abrasives be used for seating brushes 
(or smoothing commutators), since they contain conductive 
materials that cause arcing between brushes and commutator 
bars. It is important that the brush spring pressure be correct. 
Excessive pressure causes rapid wear of brushes. Too little 
pressure, however, allows bouncing of the brushes, resulting 
in burned and pitted surfaces. The pressure recommended by 
the manufacturer should be checked by the use of a spring 
scale graduated in ounces. Brush spring tension on some 
generators can be adjusted. A spring scale is used to measure 
the pressure that a brush exerts on the commutator. 

Flexible low-resistance pigtails are provided on most heavy 
current carrying brushes, and their connections should be 
securely made and checked at frequent intervals. The pigtails 
should never be permitted to alter or restrict the free motion of 
the brush. The purpose of the pigtail is to conduct the current 
from the armature, through the brushes, to the external circuit 
of the generator. 

Generator Controls
Theory of Generator Control
All aircraft are designed to operate within a specific voltage 
range (for example 13.5–14.5 volts). And since aircraft 
operate at a variety of engine speeds (remember, the engine 
drives the generator) and with a variety of electrical demands, 
all generators must be regulated by some control system. The 
generator control system is designed to keep the generator 
output within limits for all flight variables. Generator 
control systems are often referred to as voltage regulators 
or generator control units (GCU). 

Aircraft generator output can easily be adjusted through 
control of the generator’s magnetic field strength. Remember, 
the strength of the magnetic field has a direct effect on 
generator output. More field current means more generator 
output and vice versa. Figure 9-54 shows a simple generator 
control used to adjust field current. When field current is 
controlled, generator output is controlled. Keep in mind, this 
system is manually adjusted and would not be suitable for 
aircraft. Aircraft systems must be automatic and are therefore 
a bit more complex.

There are two basic types of generator controls: 
electro-mechanical and solid-state (transistorized). The 
electromechanical type controls are found on older aircraft 
and tend to require regular inspection and maintenance. 
Solid-state systems are more modern and typically 
considered to have better reliability and more accurate 
generator output control.

Functions of Generator Control Systems
Most generator control systems perform a number of 
functions related to the regulation, sensing, and protection 
of the DC generation system. Light aircraft typically 
require a less complex generator control system than larger 
multiengine aircraft. Some of the functions listed below are 
not found on light aircraft. 

Voltage Regulation

The most basic of the GCU functions is that of voltage 
regulation. Regulation of any kind requires the regulation 
unit to take a sample of a generator output and compare 
that sample to a known reference. If the generator’s output 
voltage falls outside of the set limits, then the regulation unit 
must provide an adjustment to the generator field current. 
Adjusting field current controls generator output. 

Overvoltage Protection

The overvoltage protection system compares the sampled 
voltage to a reference voltage. The overvoltage protection 
circuit is used to open the relay that controls the field 
excitation current. It is typically found on more complex 
generator control systems.

Parallel Generator Operations

On multiengine aircraft, a paralleling feature must be 
employed to ensure all generators operate within limits. In 
general, paralleling systems compare the voltages between 
two or more generators and adjust the voltage regulation 
circuit accordingly. 

Overexcitation Protection

When one generator in a paralleled system fails, one of the 
generators can become overexcited and tends to carry more 
than its share of the load, if not all of the loads. Basically, 
this condition causes the generator to produce too much 
current. If this condition is sensed, the overexcited generator 
must be brought back within limits, or damage occurs. The 
overexcitation circuit often works in conjunction with the 
overvoltage circuit to control the generator. 

Differential Voltage

This function of a control system is designed to ensure all 
generator voltage values are within a close tolerance before 
being connected to the load bus. If the output is not within 
the specified tolerance, then the generator contactor is not 
allowed to connect the generator to the load bus. 

Reverse Current Sensing

If the generator cannot maintain the required voltage level, 
it eventually begins to draw current instead of providing it. 
This situation occurs, for example, if a generator fails. When 

a generator fails, it becomes a load to the other operating 
generators or the battery. The defective generator must be 
removed from the bus. The reverse current sensing function 
monitors the system for a reverse current. Reverse current 
indicates that current is flowing to the generator not from 
the generator. If this occurs, the system opens the generator 
relay and disconnects the generator from the bus. 

Generator Controls for High Output Generators
Most modern high output generators are found on turbine-
powered corporate-type aircraft. These small business 
jets and turboprop aircraft employ a generator and starter 
combined into one unit. This unit is referred to as a starter-
generator. A starter-generator has the advantage of combining 
two units into one housing, saving space and weight. Since 
the starter-generator performs two tasks, engine starting and 
generation of electrical power, the control system for this unit 
is relatively complex. 

A simple explanation of a starter-generator shows that the 
unit contains two sets of field windings. One field is used to 
start the engine and one used for the generation of electrical 
power. [Figure 9-55]

During the start function, the GCU must energize the series 
field and the armature causes the unit to act like a motor. 
During the generating mode, the GCU must disconnect 
the series field, energize the parallel field, and control the 
current produced by the armature. At this time, the starter-
generator acts like a typical generator. Of course, the GCU 
must perform all the functions described earlier to control 
voltage and protect the system. These functions include 
voltage regulation, reverse current sensing, differential 
voltage, overexcitation protection, overvoltage protection, 
and parallel generator operations. A typical GCU is shown 
in Figure 9-56.

In general, modern GCUs for high-output generators employ 
solid-state electronic circuits to sense the operations of the 
generator or starter-generator. The circuitry then controls a 
series of relays and/or solenoids to connect and disconnect the 
unit to various distribution buses. One unit found in almost 
all voltage regulation circuitry is the zener diode. The zener 
diode is a voltage sensitive device that is used to monitor 
system voltage. The zener diode, connected in conjunction 
to the GCU circuitry, then controls the field current, which 
in turn controls the generator output. 

Generator Controls for Low-Output Generators
A typical generator control circuit for low-output generators 
modifies current flow to the generator field to control 
generator output power. As flight variables and electrical 
loads change, the GCU must monitor the electrical system and 
make the appropriate adjustments to ensure proper system 
voltage and current. The typical generator control is referred 
to as a voltage regulator or a GCU. 

Since most low-output generators are found on older aircraft, 
the control systems for these systems are electromechanical 
devices. (Solid-state units are found on more modern aircraft 
that employ DC alternators and not DC generators.) The 
two most common types of voltage regulator are the carbon 

pile regulator and the three-unit regulator. Each of these 
units controls field current using a type of variable resistor. 
Controlling field current then controls generator output. A 
simplified generator control circuit is shown in Figure 9-57.
 
Carbon Pile Regulators

The carbon pile regulator controls DC generator output by 
sending the field current through a stack of carbon disks 
(the carbon pile). The carbon disks are in series with the 
generator field. If the resistance of the disks increases, 
the field current decreases and the generator output goes 
down. If the resistance of the disks decreases, the field 
current increases and generator output goes up. As seen 
in Figure 9-58, a voltage coil is installed in parallel with 
the generator output leads. The voltage coil acts like an 
electromagnet that increases or decrease strength as generator 
output voltage changes. The magnetism of the voltage coil 
controls the pressure on the carbon stack. The pressure on 
the carbon stack controls the resistance of the carbon; the 
resistance of the carbon controls field current and the field 
current controls generator output. 

Carbon pile regulators require regular maintenance to ensure 
accurate voltage regulation; therefore, most have been 
replaced on aircraft with more modern systems.

Three-Unit Regulators 

The three-unit regulator used with DC generator systems is 
made of three distinct units. Each of these units performs 
a specific function vital to correct electrical system 
operation. A typical three-unit regulator consists of three 
relays mounted in a single housing. Each of the three relays 
monitors generator outputs and opens or closes the relay 
contact points according to system needs. A typical three-
unit regulator is shown in Figure 9-59.

Voltage Regulator

The voltage regulator section of the three-unit regulator 
is used to control generator output voltage. The voltage 
regulator monitors generator output and controls the 
generator field current as needed. If the regulator senses 
that system voltage is too high, the relay points open and the 
current in the field circuit must travel through a resistor. This 
resistor lowers field current and therefore lowers generator 
output. Remember, generator output goes down whenever 
generator field current goes down. 

As seen in Figure 9-60, the voltage coil is connected in parallel 
with the generator output, and it therefore measures the 
voltage of the system. If voltage gets beyond a predetermined 
limit, the voltage coil becomes a strong magnet and opens the 
contact points. If the contact points are open, field current 
must travel through a resistor and therefore field current goes 
down. The dotted arrow shows the current flow through the 
voltage regulator when the relay points are open.

Since this voltage regulator has only two positions (points 
open and points closed), the unit must constantly be in 
adjustment to maintain accurate voltage control. During 
normal system operation, the points are opening and closing 
at regular intervals. The points are in effect vibrating. This 
type of regulator is sometimes referred to as a vibrating-
type regulator. As the points vibrate, the field current raises 
and lowers and the field magnetism averages to a level that  

maintains the correct generator output voltage. If the system 
requires more generator output, the points remain closed 
longer and vice versa. 

Current Limiter

The current limiter section of the three-unit regulator is 
designed to limit generator output current. This unit contains 
a relay with a coil wired in series with respect to the generator 
output. As seen in Figure 9-61, all the generator output 
current must travel through the current coil of the relay. This 
creates a relay that is sensitive to the current output of the 
generator. That is, if generator output current increases, the 
relay points open and vice versa. The dotted line shows the 
current flow to the generator field when the current limiter 
points are open. It should be noted that, unlike the voltage 
regulator relay, the current limiter is typically closed during 
normal flight. Only during extreme current loads must the 
current limiter points open; at that time, field current is 
lowered and generator output is kept within limits.

Reverse-Current Relay

The third unit of a three-unit regulator is used to prevent 
current from leaving the battery and feeding the generator. 
This type of current flow would discharge the battery and is 
opposite of normal operation. It can be thought of as a reverse 
current situation and is known as reverse-current relay. The 
simple reverse-current relay shown in Figure 9-62 contains 
both a voltage coil and a current coil.

The voltage coil is wired in parallel to the generator output 
and is energized any time the generator output reaches its 
operational voltage. As the voltage coil is energized, the 
contact points close and the current is then allowed to flow 
to the aircraft electrical loads, as shown by the dotted lines. 
The diagram shows the reverse current relay in its normal 

operating position; the points are closed and current is 
flowing from the generator to the aircraft electrical loads. 
As current flows to the loads, the current coil is energized 
and the points remain closed. If there is no generator output 
due to a system failure, the contact points open because 
magnetism in the relay is lost. With the contact points open, 
the generator is automatically disconnected from the aircraft 
electrical system, which prevents reverse flow from the load 
bus to the generator. A typical three-unit regulator for aircraft 
generators is shown in Figure 9-63. 

As seen in Figure 9-63, all three units of the regulator work 
together to control generator output. The regulator monitors 
generator output and controls power to the aircraft loads as 
needed for flight variables. Note that the vibrating regulator 
just described was simplified for explanation purposes. 
A typical vibrating regulator found on an aircraft would 
probably be more complex.

DC Alternators and Controls
DC alternators (like generators) change mechanical energy 
into electrical energy by the process of electromagnetic 
induction. In general, DC alternators are lighter and more 
efficient than DC generators. DC alternators and their related 
controls are found on modern, light, piston-engine aircraft. 
The alternator is mounted in the engine compartment driven 
by a v-belt, or drive gear mechanism, which receives power 
from the aircraft engine. [Figure 9-64] The control system 
of a DC alternator is used to automatically regulate alternator 
output power and ensure the correct system voltage for 
various flight parameters.

DC Alternators 
DC alternators contain two major components: the armature 
winding and the field winding. The field winding (which 
produces a magnetic field) rotates inside the armature and, 
using the process of electromagnetic induction, the armature 
produces a voltage. This voltage produced by the armature 
is fed to the aircraft electrical bus and produces a current to 
power the electrical loads. Figure 9-65 shows a basic diagram 
of a typical alternator. 

The armature used in DC alternators actually contains three 
coils of wire. Each coil receives current as the magnetic 
field rotates inside the armature. The resulting output 
voltage consists of three distinct AC sine waves, as shown 
in Figure 9-66. The armature winding is known as a three- 
phase armature, named after the three different voltage 
waveforms produced. 

Figure 9-67 shows the two common methods used to connect 
the three phase armature windings: the delta winding and 
the Y winding. For all practical purposes, the two windings 
produce the same results in aircraft DC alternators. 

Since the three-phase voltage produced by the alternators 
armature is AC, it is not compatible with typical DC electrical 
loads and must be rectified (changed to DC). Therefore, the 
armature output current is sent through a rectifier assembly that 
changes the three-phase AC to DC. [Figure 9-67] Each phase 
of the three-phase armature overlaps when rectified, and the 
output becomes a relatively smooth ripple DC. [Figure 9-68]

The invention of the diode has made the development of the 
alternator possible. The rectifier assembly is comprised of 
six diodes. This rectifier assembly replaces the commutator 
and brushes found on DC generators and helps to make the 
alternator more efficient. Figure 9-69 shows the inside of a 
typical alternator; the armature assembly is located on the 
outer edges of the alternator and the diodes are mounted to 
the case.

Figure 9-71. Alternator brushes.

The field winding, shown in Figure 9-70, is mounted to a 
rotor shaft so it can spin inside of the armature assembly.

The field winding must receive current from an aircraft 
battery in order to produce an electromagnet. Since the field 
rotates, a set of brushes must be used to send power to the 
rotating field. Two slip rings are mounted to the rotor and 
connect the field winding to electrical contacts called brushes. 
Since the brushes carry relatively low current, the brushes 
of an alternator are typically smaller than those found inside 
a DC generator. [Figure 9-71] DC alternator brushes last 
longer and require less maintenance than those found in a 
DC generator.

The alternator case holds the alternator components inside 
a compact housing that mounts to the engine. Aircraft 
alternators either produce a nominal 14-volt output or 
a 26-volt output. The physical size of the alternator is 
typically a function of the alternator’s amperage output. 
Common alternators for light aircraft range in output form  
60–120 amps. 

Alternator Voltage Regulators 
Voltage regulators for DC alternators are similar to those 
found on DC generators. The general concepts are the same 
in that adjusting alternator field current controls alternator 
output. Regulators for most DC alternators are either the 
vibrating-relay type or solid-state regulators, which are found 
on most modern aircraft. Vibrating-relay regulators are similar 
to those discussed in the section on generator regulators. As 
the points of the relay open, the field current is lowered and 
alternator output is lowered and vice versa. 

Solid-State Regulators
Solid-state regulators for modern light aircraft are often 
referred to as alternator control units (ACUs). These units 
contain no moving parts and are generally considered 
to be more reliable and provide better system regulation 
than vibrating-type regulators. Solid-state regulators rely 
on transistor circuitry to control alternator field current 
and alternator output. The regulator monitors alternator 
output voltage/current and controls alternator field current 
accordingly. Solid-state regulators typically provide 
additional protection circuitry not found in vibrating-type 
regulators. Protection may include over- or under-voltage 
protection, overcurrent protection, as well as monitoring the 
alternator for internal defects, such as a defective diode. In 
many cases, the ACU also provides a warning indication to 
the pilot if a system malfunction occurs. 

A key component of any solid-state voltage regulator is known 
as the zener diode. Figure 9-72 shows the schematic diagram 
symbol of a zener diode, as well as one installed in an ACU. 

The operation of a zener diode is similar to a common diode 
in that the zener only permits current flow in one direction. 
This is true until the voltage applied to the zener reaches a 
certain level. At that predetermined voltage level, the zener 
then permits current flow with either polarity. This is known 
as the breakdown or zener voltage.

Figure 9-74. Inverter.

As an ACU monitors alternator output, the zener diode is 
connected to system voltage. When the alternator output 
reaches the specific zener voltage, the diode controls a 
transistor in the circuit, which in turn controls the alternator 
field current. This is a simplified explanation of the complete 
circuitry of an ACU. [Figure 9-73] However, it is easy to see 
how the zener diode and transistor circuit are used in place 
of an electromechanical relay in a vibrating-type regulator. 
The use of solid-state components creates a more accurate 
regulator that requires very little maintenance. The solid- 
state ACU is, therefore, the control unit of choice for modern 
aircraft with DC alternators. 

Power Systems
Since certain electrical systems operate only on AC, many 
aircraft employ a completely AC electrical system, as well 
as a DC system. The typical AC system would include 
an AC alternator (generator), a regulating system for that 
alternator, AC power distribution buses, and related fuses and 
wiring. Note that when referring to AC systems, the terms 
“alternator” and “generator” are often used interchangeably. 
This chapter uses the term “AC alternator.” 

AC power systems are becoming more popular on modern 
aircraft. Light aircraft tend to operate most electrical systems 
using DC, therefore the DC battery can easily act as a backup 
power source. Some modern light aircraft also employ a small 
AC system. In this case, the light aircraft probably uses an 
AC inverter to produce the AC needed for this system. 

Inverters are commonly used when only a small amount of 
AC is required for certain systems. Inverters may also be 
used as a backup AC power source on aircraft that employ 
an AC alternator. Figure 9-74 shows a typical inverter that 
might be found on modern aircraft. 

A modern inverter is a solid-state device that converts 
DC power into AC power. The electronic circuitry within 
an inverter is quite complex; however, for an aircraft 
technician’s purposes, the inverter is simply a device that 
uses DC power, then feeds power to an AC distribution bus. 
Many inverters supply both 26-volt AC, as well as 115-volt 
AC. The aircraft can be designed to use either voltage or both 
simultaneously. If both voltages are used, the power must be 
distributed on separate 26-and 115-volt AC buses. 

AC Alternators   
AC alternators are found only on aircraft that use a large 
amount of electrical power. Virtually all transport category 
aircraft, such as the Boeing 757 or the Airbus A-380, employ 
one AC alternator driven by each engine. These aircraft 
also have an auxiliary AC alternator driven by the auxiliary 
power unit. In most cases, transport category aircraft also 
have at least one more AC backup power source, such as 
an AC inverter or a small AC alternator driven by a ram-air 
turbine (RAT).

Figure 9-75. AC alternator sine waves.

Figure 9-76. Large aircraft AC alternator.

AC alternators produce a three-phase AC output. For each 
revolution of the alternator, the unit produces three separate 
voltages. The sine waves for these voltages are separated 
by 120°. [Figure 9-75] This wave pattern is similar to those 
produced internally by a DC alternator; however, in this case, 
the AC alternator does not rectify the voltage and the output 
of the unit is AC. 

The modern AC alternator does not utilize brushes or slip 
rings and is often referred to as a brushless AC alternator. 
This brushless design is extremely reliable and requires 
very little maintenance. In a brushless alternator, energy to 
or from the alternator’s rotor is transferred using magnetic 
energy. In other words, energy from the stator to the rotor 
is transferred using magnetic flux energy and the process 
of electromagnetic induction. A typical large aircraft AC 
alternator is shown in Figure 9-76.

As seen in Figure 9-77, the brushless alternator actually 
contains three generators: the exciter generator (armature 
and permanent magnet field), the pilot exciter generator 
(armature and fields windings), and the main AC alternator 
(armature winding and field windings). The need for 
brushes is eliminated by using a combination of these three  
distinct generators. 

The exciter is a small AC generator with a stationary field 
made of a permanent magnet and two electromagnets. The 
exciter armature is three phase and mounted on the rotor shaft. 
The exciter armature output is rectified and sent to the pilot 
exciter field and the main generator field. 

The pilot exciter field is mounted on the rotor shaft and is 
connected in series with the main generator field. The pilot 
exciter armature is mounted on the stationary part of the 
assembly. The AC output of the pilot exciter armature is 
supplied to the generator control circuitry where it is rectified, 
regulated, and then sent to the exciter field windings. The 
current sent to the exciter field provides the voltage regulation 
for the main AC alternator. If greater AC alternator output 
is needed, there is more current sent to the exciter field and 
vice versa. 

In short, the exciter permanent magnet and armature starts the 
generation process, and the output of the exciter armature is 
rectified and sent to the pilot exciter field. The pilot exciter 
field creates a magnetic field and induces power in the 
pilot exciter armature through electromagnetic induction. 
The output of the pilot exciter armature is sent to the main 
alternator control unit and then sent back to the exciter field. 
As the rotor continues to turn, the main AC alternator field 
generates power into the main AC alternator armature, also 
using electromagnetic induction. The output of the main AC 
armature is three-phase AC and used to power the various 
electrical loads. 

Some alternators are cooled by circulating oil through the 
internal components of the alternator. The oil used for 
cooling is supplied from the constant speed drive assembly 
and often cooled by an external oil cooler assembly. Located 
in the flange connecting the generator and drive assemblies, 
ports make oil flow between the constant speed drive and 
the generator possible. This oil level is critical and typically 
checked on a routine basis. 

Alternator Drive 
The unit shown in Figure 9-78 contains an alternator assembly 
combined with an automatic drive mechanism. The automatic 
drive controls the alternator’s rotational speed which allows 
the alternator to maintain a constant 400-Hz AC output. 

All AC alternators must rotate at a specific rpm to keep 
the frequency of the AC voltage within limits. Aircraft AC 
alternators should produce a frequency of approximately 
400 Hz. If the frequency strays more than 10  percent from 
this value, the electrical systems do not operate correctly. A 
unit called a constant-speed drive (CSD) is used to ensure 
the alternator rotates at the correct speed to ensure a 400-  
Hz frequency. The CSD can be an independent unit or

mounted within the alternator housing. When the CSD and 
the alternator are contained within one unit, the assembly is 
known as an integrated drive generator (IDG). 

The CSD is a hydraulic unit similar to an automatic 
transmission found in a modern automobile. The engine of 
the automobile can change rpm while the speed of the car 
remains constant. This is the same process that occurs for an 
aircraft AC alternator. If the aircraft engine changes speed, 
the alternator speed remains constant. A typical hydraulic-
type drive is shown in Figure 9-79. This unit can be controlled 
either electrically or mechanically. Modern aircraft employ 
an electronic system. The constant-speed drive enables the 
alternator to produce the same frequency at slightly above 
engine idle rpm as it does at maximum engine rpm. 

The hydraulic transmission is mounted between the AC 
alternator and the aircraft engine. Hydraulic oil or engine oil 
is used to operate the hydraulic transmission, which creates a 
constant output speed to drive the alternator. In some cases, 
this same oil is used to cool the alternator as shown in the CSD 
cutaway view of Figure 9-79. The input drive shaft is powered 
by the aircraft engine gear case. The output drive shaft, on the 
opposite end of the transmission, engages the drive shaft of 
the alternator. The CSD employs a hydraulic pump assembly, 
a mechanical speed control, and a hydraulic drive. Engine 
rpm drives the hydraulic pump, the hydraulic drive turns the 

alternator. The speed control unit is made up of a wobble plate 
that adjusts hydraulic pressure to control output speed. 

Figure 9-80 shows a typical electrical circuit used to control 
alternator speed. The circuit controls the hydraulic assembly 
found in a typical CSD. As shown, the alternator input speed 
is monitored by a tachometer (tach) generator. The tach 
generator signal is rectified and sent to the valve assembly. 
The valve assembly contains three electromagnetic coils that 
operate the valve. The AC alternator output is sent through a 
control circuit that also feeds the hydraulic valve assembly. 
By balancing the force created by the three electromagnets, 
the valve assembly controls the flow of fluid through 
the automatic transmission and controls the speed of the  
AC alternator. 

It should be noted that an AC alternator also produces a 
constant 400 Hz if that alternator is driven directly by an 
engine that rotates at a constant speed. On many aircraft, 
the auxiliary power unit operates at a constant rpm. AC 
alternators driven by these APUs are typically driven 
directly by the engine, and there is no CSD required. For 
these units, the APU engine controls monitor the alternator 
output frequency. If the alternator output frequency varies 
from 400 Hz, the APU speed control adjusts the engine rpm 
accordingly to keep the alternator output within limits.

AC Alternators Control Systems 
Modern aircraft that employ AC alternators use several 
computerized control units, typically located in the aircraft’s 
equipment bay for the regulation of AC power throughout the 
aircraft. Figure 9-81 shows a photo of a typical equipment 
bay and computerized control units.

Since AC alternators are found on large transport category 
aircraft designed to carry hundreds of passengers, their 
control systems always have redundant computers that 
provide safety in the event of a system failure. Unlike DC 
systems, AC systems must ensure that the output frequency 
of the alternator stays within limits. If the frequency of an 
alternator varies from 400 Hz, or if two or more alternators 
connected to the same bus are out of phase, damage occurs to 
the system. All AC alternator control units contain circuitry 
that regulates both voltage and frequency. These control 
units also monitor a variety of factors to detect any system

failures and take protective measures to ensure the integrity 
of the electrical system. The two most common units used to 
control AC alternators are the bus power control unit (BPCU) 
and the GCU. In this case, the term “generator” is used, and 
not alternator, although the meaning is the same. 

The GCU is the main computer that controls alternator 
functions. The BPCU is the computer that controls the 
distribution of AC power to the power distribution buses 
located throughout the aircraft. There is typically one GCU 
used to monitor and control each AC alternator, and there 
can be one or more BPCUs on the aircraft. BPCUs are 
described later in this chapter; however, please note that the 
BPCU works in conjunction with the GCUs to control AC 
on modern aircraft. 

A typical GCU ensures the AC alternator maintains a 
constant voltage, typically between 115 to 120 volts. The 
GCU ensures the maximum power output of the alternator 
is never exceeded. The GCU provides fault detection and 
circuit protection in the event of an alternator failure. The 
GCU monitors AC frequency and ensures the output if the 
alternator remains 400 Hz. The basic method of voltage 
regulation is similar to that found in all alternator systems; the 
output of the alternator is controlled by changing the strength 
of a magnetic field. As shown in Figure 9-82, the GCU 
controls the exciter field magnetism within the brushless 
alternator to control alternator output voltage. The frequency 
is controlled by the CDS hydraulic unit in conjunction with 
signals monitored by the GCU. 


9-47

Figure 9-83. Light aircraft circuit breaker panel.

The GCU is also used to turn the AC alternator on or off. 
When the pilot selects the operation of an AC alternator, the 
GCU monitors the alternator’s output to ensure voltage and 
frequency are within limits. If the GCU is satisfied with the 
alternator’s output, the GCU sends a signal to an electrical 
contactor that connects the alternator to the appropriate 
AC distribution bus. The contactor, often call the generator 
breaker, is basically an electromagnetic solenoid that controls 
a set of large contact points. The large contact points are 
necessary in order to handle the large amounts of current 
produced by most AC alternators. This same contactor is 
activated in the event the GCU detects a fault in the alternator 
output; however, in this case the contactor would disconnect 
the alternator from the bus. 

Aircraft Electrical Systems
Virtually all aircraft contain some form of an electrical 
system. The most basic aircraft must produce electricity for 
operation of the engine’s ignition system. Modern aircraft 
have complex electrical systems that control almost every 
aspect of flight. In general, electrical systems can be divided 
into different categories according to the function of the 
system. Common systems include lighting, engine starting, 
and power generation. 

Small Single-Engine Aircraft
Light aircraft typically have a relatively simple electrical 
system because simple aircraft generally require less 
redundancy and less complexity than larger transport 
category aircraft. On most light aircraft, there is only one 
electrical system powered by the engine-driven alternator or 
generator. The aircraft battery is used for emergency power 
and engine starting. Electrical power is typically distributed 
through one or more common points known as an electrical 
bus (or bus bar). 

Almost all electrical circuits must be protected from faults 
that can occur in the system. Faults are commonly known 
as opens or shorts. An open circuit is an electrical fault that 
occurs when a circuit becomes disconnected. A short circuit is 
an electrical fault that occurs when one or more circuits create 
an unwanted connection. The most dangerous short circuit 
occurs when a positive wire creates an unwanted connection 
to a negative connection or ground. This is typically called 
a short to ground. 

There are two ways to protect electrical systems from faults: 
mechanically and electrically. Mechanically, wires and 
components are protected from abrasion and excess wear 
through proper installation and by adding protective covers 
and shields. Electrically, wires can be protected using circuit 
breakers and fuses. The circuit breakers protect each system 
in the event of a short circuit. It should be noted that fuses 

can be used instead of circuit breakers. Fuses are typically 
found on older aircraft. A circuit breaker panel from a light 
aircraft is shown in Figure 9-83.

Battery Circuit
The aircraft battery and battery circuit is used to supply 
power for engine starting and to provide a secondary power 
supply in the event of an alternator (or generator) failure. A 
schematic of a typical battery circuit is shown in Figure 9-84. 
This diagram shows the relationship of the starter and external 
power circuits that are discussed later in this chapter. The 
bold lines found on the diagram represent large wire (see the 
wire leaving the battery positive connection), which is used in 
the battery circuit due to the heavy current provided through 
these wires. Because batteries can supply large current flows, 
a battery is typically connected to the system through an 
electrical solenoid. At the start/end of each flight, the battery 
is connected/disconnected from the electrical distribution bus 
through the solenoid contacts. A battery master switch on the 
flight deck is used to control the solenoid.

Although they are very similar, there is often confusion 
between the terms “solenoid” and “relay.” A solenoid is 
typically used for switching high current circuits and relays 
used to control lower current circuits. To help illuminate the 
confusion, the term “contactor” is often used when describing 
a magnetically operated switch. For general purposes, an 
aircraft technician may consider the terms relay, solenoid, 
and contactor synonymous. Each of these three terms may 
be used on diagrams and schematics to describe electrical 
switches controlled by an electromagnet.
 
Here it can be seen that the battery positive wire is connected 
to the electrical bus when the battery master switch is active. 
A battery solenoid is shown in Figure 9-85. The battery 
switch is often referred to as the master switch since it turns

battery connection. Note how the electrical connections of 
the battery solenoid are protected from electrical shorts by 
rubber covers at the end of each wire.

The ammeter shown in the battery circuit is used to monitor 
the current flow from the battery to the distribution bus. When 
all systems are operating properly, battery current should flow 
from the main bus to the battery giving a positive indication on 
the ammeter. In this case, the battery is being charged. If the 
aircraft alternator (or generator) experiences a malfunction, 
the ammeter indicates a negative value. A negative indication 

means current is leaving the battery to power any electrical 
load connected to the bus. The battery is being discharged and 
the aircraft is in danger of losing all electrical power. 

Generator Circuit
Generator circuits are used to control electrical power 
between the aircraft generator and the distribution bus. 
Typically, these circuits are found on older aircraft that have 
not upgraded to an alternator. Generator circuits control 
power to the field winding and electrical power from the 
generator to the electrical bus. A generator master switch is 
used to turn on the generator typically by controlling field 
current. If the generator is spinning and current is sent to 
the field circuit, the generator produces electrical power. 
The power output of the generator is controlled through the 
generator control unit (or voltage regulator). A simplified 
generator control circuit is shown in Figure 9-86. 

As can be seen in Figure 9-86, the generator switch controls 
the power to the generator field (F terminal). The generator 
output current is supplied to the aircraft bus through the 
armature circuit (A terminal) of the generator. 

Alternator Circuit
Alternator circuits, like generator circuits, must control 
power both to and from the alternator. The alternator is

controlled by the pilot through the alternator master switch. 
The alternator master switch in turn operates a circuit within 
the alternator control unit (or voltage regulator) and sends 
current to the alternator field. If the alternator is powered by the 
aircraft engine, the alternator produces electrical power for the 
aircraft electrical loads. The alternator control circuit contains 
the three major components of the alternator circuit: alternator, 
voltage regulator, and alternator master switch. [Figure 9-87]

The voltage regulator controls the generator field current 
according to aircraft electrical load. If the aircraft engine is 
running and the alternator master switch is on, the voltage 
regulator adjusts current to the alternator field as needed. 
If more current flows to the alternator field, the alternator 

output increases and feeds the aircraft loads through the 
distribution bus. 

All alternators must be monitored for correct output. Most 
light aircraft employ an ammeter to monitor alternator output. 
Figure 9-88 shows a typical ammeter circuit used to monitor 
alternator output. An ammeter placed in the alternator circuit 
is a single polarity meter that shows current flow in only one 
direction. This flow is from the alternator to the bus. Since

the alternator contains diodes in the armature circuit, current 
cannot reverse flow from the bus to the alternator.

When troubleshooting an alternator system, be sure to 
monitor the aircraft ammeter. If the alternator system is 
inoperative, the ammeter gives a zero indication. In this 
case, the battery is being discharged. A voltmeter is also a 
valuable tool when troubleshooting an alternator system. The 
voltmeter should be installed in the electrical system while 
the engine is running and the alternator operating. A system 
operating normally produces a voltage within the specified 
limits (approximately 14 volts or 28 volts depending on the 
electrical system). Consult the aircraft manual and verify the 
system voltage is correct. If the voltage is below specified 
values, the charging system should be inspected.
 
External Power Circuit
Many aircraft employ an external power circuit that provides 
a means of connecting electrical power from a ground source 
to the aircraft. External power is often used for starting the 
engine or maintenance activities on the aircraft. This type of 
system allows operation of various electrical systems without 
discharging the battery. The external power systems typically 
consists of an electrical plug located in a convenient area of 
the fuselage, an electrical solenoid used to connect external 
power to the bus, and the related wiring for the system. A 
common external power receptacle is shown in Figure 9-89. 

Figure 9-90 shows how the external power receptacle 
connects to the external power solenoid through a reverse 
polarity diode. This diode is used to prevent any accidental 
connection in the event the external power supply has the 
incorrect polarity (i.e., a reverse of the positive and negative 
electrical connections). A reverse polarity connection could 
be catastrophic to the aircraft’s electrical system. If a ground 
power source with a reverse polarity is connected, the diode 
blocks current and the external power solenoid does not close. 

This diagram also shows that external power can be used 
to charge the aircraft battery or power the aircraft electrical 
loads. For external power to start the aircraft engine or power 
electrical loads, the battery master switch must be closed. 

Starter Circuit
Virtually all modern aircraft employ an electric motor to start 
the aircraft engine. Since starting the engine requires several 
horsepower, the starter motor can often draw 100 or more 
amperes. For this reason, all starter motors are controlled 
through a solenoid. [Figure 9-91]
 
The starter circuit must be connected as close as practical 
to the battery since large wire is needed to power the starter 
motor and weight savings can be achieved when the battery 
and the starter are installed close to each other in the aircraft. 
As shown in the starter circuit diagram, the start switch can 
be part of a multifunction switch that is also used to control 
the engine magnetos. [Figure 9-92]

The starter can be powered by either the aircraft battery or 
the external power supply. Often when the aircraft battery

is weak or in need of charging, the external power circuit is 
used to power the starter. During most typical operations, the 
starter is powered by the aircraft battery. The battery master 
must be on and the master solenoid closed in order to start 
the engine with the battery. 

Avionics Power Circuit
Many aircraft contain a separate power distribution bus 
specifically for electronics equipment. This bus is often 
referred to as an avionics bus. Since modern avionics 
equipment employs sensitive electronic circuits, it is often 
advantageous to disconnect all avionics from electrical power 
to protect their circuits. For example, the avionics bus is often 
depowered when the starter motor is activated. This helps to 
prevent any transient voltage spikes produced by the starter 
from entering the sensitive avionics. [Figure 9-93]

The circuit employs a normally closed (NC) solenoid that 
connects the avionics bus to the main power bus. The 
electromagnet of the solenoid is activated whenever the 
starter is engaged. Current is sent from the starter switch 
through diode D1, causing the solenoid to open and depower 
the avionics bus. At that time, all electronics connected to 
the avionics bus will lose power. The avionics contactor is 
also activated whenever external power is connected to the 
aircraft. In this case, current travels through diodes D2 and 
D3 to the avionics bus contactor. 

A separate avionics power switch may also be used to 
disconnect the entire avionics bus. A typical avionics power 
switch is shown wired in series with the avionics power bus. 
In some cases, this switch is combined with a circuit breaker 


9-52

Figure 9-94. Instrument panel showing the landing gear position switch and the three gear down indicators. 

and performs two functions (called a circuit breaker switch). 
It should also be noted that the avionics contactor is often 
referred to as a split bus relay, since the contactor separates 
(splits) the avionics bus from the main bus. 

Landing Gear Circuit
Another common circuit found on light aircraft operates 
the retractable landing gear systems on high-performance 
light aircraft. These airplanes typically employ a hydraulic 
system to move the gear. After takeoff, the pilot moves 
the gear position switch to the retract position, starting an 
electric motor. The motor operates a hydraulic pump, and the 
hydraulic system moves the landing gear. To ensure correct 
operation of the system, the landing gear electrical system 
is relatively complex. The electrical system must detect the 
position of each gear (right, left, nose) and determine when 
each reaches full up or down; the motor is then controlled 
accordingly. There are safety systems to help prevent 
accidental actuation of the gear. 

A series of limit switches are needed to monitor the position 
of each gear during the operation of the system. (A limit 
switch is simply a spring-loaded, momentary contact switch 
that is activated when a gear reaches it limit of travel.) 
Typically, there are six limit switches located in the landing 
gear wheel wells. The three up-limit switches are used to 

detect when the gear reaches the full retract (UP) position. 
Three down-limit switches are used to detect when the gear 
reach the full extended (DOWN) position. Each of these 
switches is mechanically activated by a component of the 
landing gear assembly when the appropriate gear reaches 
a given limit.

The landing gear system must also provide an indication to 
the pilot that the gear is in a safe position for landing. Many 
aircraft employ a series of three green lights when all three 
gears are down and locked in the landing position. These three 
lights are activated by the up- and down-limit switches found 
in the gear wheel well. A typical instrument panel showing 
the landing gear position switch and the three gears down 
indicators is shown in Figure 9-94. 

The hydraulic motor/pump assembly located in the upper left 
corner of Figure 9-95 is powered through either the UP or 
DOWN solenoids (top left). The solenoids are controlled by 
the gear selector switch (bottom left) and the six landing gear 
limit switches (located in the center of Figure 9-95). The three 
gear DOWN indicators are individual green lights (center of 
Figure 9-95) controlled by the three gear DOWN switches. 
As each gear reaches its DOWN position, the limit switch 
moves to the DOWN position, and the light is illuminated.

Figure 9-95 shows the landing gear in the full DOWN 
position. It is always important to know gear position 
when reading landing gear electrical diagrams. Knowing 
gear position helps the technician to analyze the diagram 
and understand correct operation of the circuits. Another 

important concept is that more than one circuit is used to 
operate the landing gear. On this system, there is a low 
current control circuit fused at 5 amps (CB2, top right of 
Figure 9-95). This circuit is used for indicator lights and 
the control of the gear motor contactors. There is a separate

circuit to power the gear motor fused at 30 amps (CB3, top 
right of Figure 9-95). Since this circuit carries a large current 
flow, the wires would be as short as practical and carefully 
protected with rubber boots or nylon insulators. 
 
The following paragraphs describe current flow through 
the landing gear circuit as the system moves the gear up 

and down. Be sure to refer to Figure 9-96 often during the 
following discussions. Figure 9-96 shows current flow when 
the gear is traveling to the extend (DOWN) position. Current 
flow is highlighted in red for each description.

To run the gear DOWN motor, current must flow in the control 
circuit leaving CB2 through terminal 1 to the NOT DOWN 


9-55

contacts of the DOWN limit switches, through terminal 3, 
to the DOWN solenoid positive terminal (upper left). The 
negative side of the DOWN solenoid coil is connected to 
ground through the gear selector switch. Remember, the gear 
DOWN switches are wired in parallel and activated when 
the gear reach the full-DOWN position. All three gears must 
reach full-DOWN to shut off the gear DOWN motor. Also 
note that the gear selector switch controls the negative side 
of the gear solenoids. The selector switch has independent 
control of the gear UP and DOWN motors through control 
of the ground circuit to both the UP and DOWN solenoids.

When the landing gear control circuit is sending a positive 
voltage to the DOWN solenoid, and the gear selector 
switch is sending negative voltage, the solenoid magnet is 
energized. When the gear-DOWN solenoid is energized, 
the high-current gear motor circuit sends current from CB1 
through the down solenoid contact points to the gear DOWN 
motor. When the motor runs, the hydraulic pump produces 
pressure and the gear begins to move. When all three gears 
reach the DOWN position, the gear-DOWN switches move 
to the DOWN position, the three green lights illuminate, and 
the gear motor turns off completing the gear-DOWN cycle. 
 
Figure 9-97 shows the landing gear electrical diagram with 
the current flow path shown in red as the gear moves to the 
retract (UP) position. Starting in the top right corner of the 
diagram, current must flow through CB2 in the control circuit 
through terminal 1 to each of the three gear-UP switches. 
With the gear-UP switches in the not UP position, current 
flows to terminal 2 and eventually through the squat switch 
to the UP solenoid electromagnet coil. The UP solenoid coil 
receives negative voltage through the gear selector switch. 
With the UP solenoid coil activated, the UP solenoid closes 
and power travels through the motor circuit. To power the 
motor, current leaves the bus through CB1 to the terminal 
at the DOWN solenoid onward through the UP solenoid to 
the UP motor. (Remember, current cannot travel through the 
DOWN solenoid at this time since the DOWN solenoid is 
not activated.) As the UP motor runs, each gear travels to the 
retract position. As this occurs, the gear UP switches move 
from the NOT UP position to the UP position. When the last 
gear reaches up, the current no longer travels to terminal 2 
and the gear motor turns off. It should be noted that similar 
to DOWN, the gear switches are wired in parallel, which 
means the gear motor continues to run until all three gear 
reach the required position. 

During both the DOWN and UP cycles of the landing gear 
operation, current travels from the limit switches to terminal 
2. From terminal 2, there is a current path through the gear 
selector switch to the gear unsafe light. If the gear selector 
disagrees with the current gear position (e.g., gear is DOWN 

and pilot has selected UP), the unsafe light is illuminated. 
The gear unsafe light is shown at the bottom of Figure 9-96. 

The squat switch (shown mid left of Figure 9-96) is used to 
determine if the aircraft is on the GROUND or in FLIGHT. 
This switch is located on a landing gear strut. When the weight 
of the aircraft compresses the strut, the switch is activated and 
moved to the GROUND position. When the switch is in the 
GROUND position, the gear cannot be retracted and a warning 
horn sounds if the pilot selects gear UP. The squat switch is 
sometimes referred to as the weight-on-wheels switch. 

A throttle switch is also used in conjunction with landing gear 
circuits on most aircraft. If the throttle is retarded (closed) 
beyond a certain point, the aircraft descends and eventually 
lands. Therefore, many manufacturers activate a throttle 
switch whenever engine power is reduced. If engine power 
is reduced too low, a warning horn sounds telling the pilot to 
lower the landing gear. Of course, this horn need not sound 
if the gear is already DOWN or the pilot has selected the 
DOWN position on the gear switch. This same horn also 
sounds if the aircraft is on the ground, and the gear handle 
is moved to the UP position. Figure 9-96 shows the gear 
warning horn in the bottom left corner. 

AC Supply
Many modern light aircraft employ a low-power AC 
electrical system. Commonly, the AC system is used to 
power certain instruments and some lighting that operate 
only using AC. The electroluminescent panel has become 
a popular lighting system for aircraft instrument panels and 
requires AC. Electroluminescent lighting is very efficient 
and lightweight; therefore, excellent for aircraft installations. 
The electroluminescent material is a paste-like substance that 
glows when supplied with a voltage. This material is typically 
molded into a plastic panel and used for lighting.

A device called an inverter is used to supply AC when needed 
for light aircraft. Simply put, the inverter changes DC into 
AC. Two types of inverters may be found on aircraft: rotary 
inverters and static inverters. Rotary inverters are found only 
on older aircraft due to its poor reliability, excess weight, 
and inefficiency. The rotary inverters employee a DC motor 
that spins an AC generator. The unit is typically one unit and 
contains a voltage regulator circuit to ensure voltage stability. 
Most aircraft have a modern static inverter instead of a rotary 
inverter. Static inverters, as the name implies, contain no 
moving parts and use electronic circuitry to convert DC to 
AC. Figure 9-98 shows a static inverter. Whenever AC is 
used on light aircraft, a distribution circuit separated from 
the DC system must be employed. [Figure 9-99]

Some aircraft use an inverter power switch to control AC 
power. Many aircraft simply power the inverter whenever the 
DC bus is powered and no inverter power switch is needed. 
On complex aircraft, more than one inverter may be used to 

provide a backup AC power source. Many inverters also offer 
more than one voltage output. Two common voltages found 
on aircraft inverters are 26VAC and 115VAC.

Light Multiengine Aircraft
Multiengine aircraft typically fly faster, higher, and farther 
than single engine aircraft. Multiengine aircraft are designed 
for added safety and redundancy and, therefore, often contain 
a more complex power distribution system when compared to 
light single-engine aircraft. With two engines, these aircraft 
can drive two alternators (or generators) that supply current 
to the various loads of the aircraft. The electrical distribution 
bus system is also divided into two or more systems. These 
bus systems are typically connected through a series of circuit 
protectors, diodes, and relays. The bus system is designed to 
create a power distribution system that is extremely reliable by 
supplying current to most loads through more than one source.



Paralleling Alternators or Generators
Since two alternators (or generators) are used on twin engine 
aircraft, it becomes vital to ensure both alternators share the 
electrical load equally. This process of equalizing alternator 
outputs is often called paralleling. In general, paralleling is a 
simple process when dealing with DC power systems found 
on light aircraft. If both alternators are connected to the 
same load bus and both alternators produce the same output 
voltage, the alternators share the load equally. Therefore, 
the paralleling systems must ensure both power producers 
maintain system voltage within a few tenths of a volt. For 
most twin-engine aircraft, the voltage would be between 
26.5-volt and 28-volt DC with the alternators operating. A 
simple vibrating point system used for paralleling alternators 
is found in Figure 9-100. 

As can be seen in Figure 9-100, both left and right voltage 
regulators contain a paralleling coil connected to the output 
of each alternator. This paralleling coil works in conjunction 
with the voltage coil of the regulator to ensure proper 
alternator output. The paralleling coils are wired in series 
between the output terminals of both alternators. Therefore, if 
the two alternators provide equal voltages, the paralleling coil 
has no effect. If one alternator has a higher voltage output, 
the paralleling coils create the appropriate magnetic force to 
open/close the contact points, controlling field current and 
control alternator output. 

Today’s aircraft employ solid-state control circuits to ensure 
proper paralleling of the alternators. Older aircraft use 
vibrating point voltage regulators or carbon-pile regulators 
to monitor and control alternator output. For the most part, 
all carbon-pile regulators have been replaced except on 
historic aircraft. Many aircraft still maintain a vibrating point 
system, although these systems are no longer being used on

Power Distribution on Multiengine Aircraft 
The power distribution systems found on modern multiengine 
aircraft contain several distribution points (buses) and a 
variety of control and protection components to ensure 
the reliability of electrical power. As aircraft employ more 
electronics to perform various tasks, the electrical power 
systems becomes more complex and more reliable. One 
means to increase reliability is to ensure more than one 
power source can be used to power any given load. Another 
important design concept is to supply critical electrical 
loads from more than one bus. Twin-engine aircraft, such 
as a typical corporate jet or commuter aircraft, have two 
DC generators; they also have multiple distribution buses 
fed from each generator. Figure 9-101 shows a simplified 
diagram of the power distribution system for a twin-engine 
turboprop aircraft.

This aircraft contains two starter generator units used to start 
the engines and generate DC electrical power. The system 
is typically defined as a split-bus power distribution system 
since there is a left and right generator bus that splits (shares) 
the electrical loads by connecting to each sub-bus through 
a diode and current limiter. The generators are operated in 
parallel and equally carry the loads. 

The primary power supplied for this aircraft is DC, although 
small amounts of AC are supplied by two inverters. The 
aircraft diagram shows the AC power distribution at the top 
and mid left side of the diagram. One inverter is used for main 
AC power and the second operated in standby and ready as a 
backup. Both inverters produce 26-volt AC and 115-volt AC. 
There is an inverter select relay operated by a pilot controlled 
switch used to choose which inverter is active. 

The hot battery bus (right side of Figure 9-101) shows a direct 
connection to the aircraft battery. This bus is always hot if 
there is a charged battery in the aircraft. Items powered by this 
bus may include some basics like the entry door lighting and 
the aircraft clock, which should always have power available. 
Other items on this bus would be critical to flight safety, such 
as fire extinguishers, fuel shut offs, and fuel pumps. During 
a massive system failure, the hot battery bus is the last bus 
on the aircraft that should fail. 

If the battery switch is closed and the battery relay activated, 
battery power is connected to the main battery bus and the 
isolation bus. The main battery bus carries current for engine 
starts and external power. So the main battery bus must 
be large enough to carry the heaviest current loads of the 
aircraft. It is logical to place this bus as close as practical to 
the battery and starters and to ensure the bus is well protected 
from shorts to ground.

The isolation bus connects to the left and right buses and 
receives power whenever the main battery bus is energized. 
The isolation bus connects output of the left and right 
generators in parallel. The output of the two generators is 
then sent to the loads through additional buses. The generator 
buses are connected to the isolation bus through a fuse known 

as a current limiter. Current limiters are high amperage 
fuses that isolate buses if a short circuit occurs. There are 
several current limiters used in this system for protection 
between buses. As can be seen in Figure 9-101, a current 
limiter symbol looks like two triangles pointed toward each 
other. The current limiter between the isolation bus and the

main generator buses are rated at 325 amps and can only be 
replaced on the ground. Most current limiters are designed 
for ground replacement only and only after the malfunction 
that caused the excess current draw is repaired. 

The left and right DC generators are connected to their 
respective main generator buses. Each generator feeds its 
respective bus, and since the buses are connected under 
normal circumstances, the generators operate in parallel. 
Both generators feed all loads together. If one generator 
fails or a current limiter opens, the generators can operate 
independently. This design allows for redundancy in the 
event of failure and provides battery backup in the event of 
a dual generator failure. 

In the center of Figure 9-101 are four dual-feed electrical 
buses. These buses are considered dual-feed since they receive 
power from both the left and right generator buses. If a fault 
occurs, either generator bus can power any or all loads on a 
dual-feed bus. During the design phase of the aircraft, the 
electrical loads must be evenly distributed between each of 
the dual-feed buses. It is also important to power redundant 
systems from different buses. For example, the pilot’s 
windshield heat would be powered by a different bus from 
the one that powers the copilot’s windshield heat. If one bus 
fails, at least one windshield heat continues to work properly, 
and the aircraft can be landed safely in icing conditions. 

Notice that the dual-feed buses are connected to the main 
generator buses through both a current limiter and a diode. 
Remember, a diode allows current flow in only one direction. 
[Figure 9-102]

The current can flow from the generator bus to the dual-feed 
bus, but the current cannot flow from the dual fed bus to the 
main generator bus. The diode is placed in the circuit so the 
main bus must be more positive than the sub bus for current 
flow. This circuit also contains a current limiter and a circuit 
breaker. The circuit breaker is located on the flight deck and 
can be reset by the pilot. The current limiter can only be 
replaced on the ground by a technician. The circuit breaker is 
rated at a slightly lower current value than the current limiter; 
therefore, the circuit breaker should open if a current overload 

exists. If the circuit breaker fails to open, the current limiter 
provides backup protection and disconnects the circuit. 

Large Multiengine Aircraft
Transport category aircraft typically carry hundreds of 
passengers and fly thousands of miles each trip. Therefore, 
large aircraft require extremely reliable power distribution 
systems that are computer controlled. These aircraft have 
multiple power sources (AC generators) and a variety of 
distribution buses. A typical airliner contains two or more 
main AC generators driven by the aircraft turbine engines, 
as well as more than one backup AC generator. DC systems 
are also employed on large aircraft and the ship’s battery is 
used to supply emergency power in case of a multiple failures. 
 
The AC generator (sometimes called an alternator) produces 
three-phase 115-volt AC at 400 Hz. AC generators were 
discussed previously in this chapter. Since most modern 
transport category aircraft are designed with two engines, 
there are two main AC generators. The APU also drives an 
AC generator. This unit is available during flight if one of the 
main generators fails. The main and auxiliary generators are 
typically similar in output capacity and supply a maximum 
of 110 kilovolt amps (KVA). A fourth generator, driven by 
an emergency ram air turbine, is also available in the event 
the two main generators and one auxiliary generator fail. 
The emergency generator is typically smaller and produces 
less power. With four AC generators available on modern 
aircraft, it is highly unlikely that a complete power failure 
occurs. However, if all AC generators are lost, the aircraft 
battery will continue to supply DC electrical power to operate 
vital systems. 

AC Power Systems
Transport category aircraft use large amounts of electrical 
power for a variety of systems. Passenger comfort requires 
power for lighting, audio visual systems, and galley power 
for food warmers and beverage coolers. A variety of electrical 
systems are required to fly the aircraft, such as flight control 
systems, electronic engine controls, communication, and 
navigation systems. The output capacity of one engine-driven 
AC generator can typically power all necessary electrical

systems. A second engine-driven generator is operated during 
flight to share the electrical loads and provide redundancy. 

The complexity of multiple generators and a variety of 
distribution buses requires several control units to maintain 
a constant supply of safe electrical power. The AC electrical 
system must maintain a constant output of 115 to 120 volts at 
a frequency of 400 Hz (±10 percent). The system must ensure 
power limits are not exceeded. AC generators are connected 
to the appropriate distribution buses at the appropriate time, 
and generators are in phase when needed. There is also the 
need to monitor and control any external power supplied to 
the aircraft, as well as control of all DC electrical power. 

Two electronic line replaceable units are used to control the 
electrical power on a typical large aircraft. The  generator 
control unit (GCU) is used for control of AC generator 
functions, such as voltage regulation and frequency control. 
The  bus power control unit (BPCU) is used to control 
the distribution of electrical power between the various 
distribution buses on the aircraft. The GCU and BPCU 
work together to control electrical power, detect faults, take 
corrective actions when needed, and report any defect to the 
pilots and the aircraft’s central maintenance system. There 
is typically one GCU for each AC generator and at least one 
BPCU to control bus connections. These LRUs are located 
in the aircraft’s electronics equipment bay and are designed 
for easy replacement. 

When the pilot calls for generator power by activating the 
generator control switch on the flight deck, the GCU monitors 
the system to ensure correct operation. If all systems are 
operating within limits, the GCU energizes the appropriate 
generator circuits and provides voltage regulation for the 
system. The GCU also monitors AC output to ensure a 
constant 400-Hz frequency. If the generator output is within 
limits, the GCU then connects the electrical power to the main 
generator bus through an electrical contactor (solenoid). These 
contactors are often called generator breakers (GB) since 
they break (open) or make (close) the main generator circuit. 

After generator power is available, the BPCU activates various 
contactors to distribute the electrical power. The BPCU 
monitors the complete electrical system and communicates 
with the GCU to ensure proper operation. The BPCU employs 
remote current sensors known as a current transformers (CT) 
to monitor the system. [Figure 9-103]

A CT is an inductive unit that surrounds the main power 
cables of the electrical distribution system. As AC power 
flows through the main cables, the CT receives an induced 
voltage. The amount of CT voltage is directly related to the 
current flowing through the cable. The CT connects to the 

BPCU, which allows accurate current monitoring of the 
system. A typical aircraft employs several CTs throughout 
the electrical system. 

The BPCU is a dedicated computer that controls the electrical 
connections between the various distribution buses found on 
the aircraft. The BPCU uses contactors (solenoids) called bus 
tie breakers (BTB) for connection of various circuits. These 
BTBs open/close the connections between the buses as needed 
for system operation as called for by the pilots and the BPCU. 
This sounds like a simple task, yet to ensure proper operation 
under a variety of conditions, the bus system becomes very 
complex. There are three common types of distribution bus 
systems found on transport category aircraft: split bus, parallel 
bus, and split parallel. 

Split-Bus Power Distribution Systems 

Modern twin-engine aircraft, such as the Boeing 737, 757, 
777, Airbus A-300, A-320, and A-310, employ a split-bus 
power distribution system. During normal conditions, each 
engine-driven AC generator powers only one main AC bus. 
The buses are kept split from each other, and two generators 
can never power the same bus simultaneously. This is very 
important since the generator output current is not phase 
regulated. (If two out-of-phase generators were connected 
to the same bus, damage to the system would occur.) The 
split-bus system does allow both engine-driven generators 
to power any given bus, but not at the same time. Generators 
must remain isolated from each other to avoid damage. The 
GCUs and BPCU ensures proper generator operation and 
power distribution.

On all modern split bus systems, the APU can be started 
and operated during flight. This allows the APU generator 
to provide back-up power in the event of a main generator 
failure. A fourth emergency generator powered by the ram air 
turbine is also available if the other generators fail.

Figure 9-104. Schematic of split-bus power distribution system.

The four AC generators are shown at the bottom of 
Figure 9-104. These generators are connected to their 
respective buses through the generator breakers. For example, 
generator 1 sends current through GB1 to AC bus 1. AC bus 
1 feeds a variety of primary electrical loads, and also feeds 
sub-buses that in turn power additional loads. 

With both generators operating and all systems normal, AC 
bus 1 and AC bus 2 are kept isolated. Typically during flight, 
the APB (bottom center of Figure 9-104) would be open and 
the APU generator off; the emergency generator (bottom 
right) would also be off and disconnected. If generator one 
should fail, the following happens: 

1.  The GB 1 is opened by the GCU to disconnect the 
failed generator. 

2.  The BPCU closes BTB 1 and BTB 2. This supplies 
AC power to AC bus 1 from generator 2. 

3.  The pilots start the APU and connect the APU 
generator. At that time, the BPCU and GCUs move the 
appropriate BTBs to correctly configure the system so 
the APU powers bus 1 and generator 2 powers bus 2. 

Once again, two AC generators operate independently 
to power AC bus 1 and 2. 

If all generators fail, AC is also available through the static 
inverter (center of Figure 9-104). The inverter is powered 
from the hot battery bus and used for essential AC loads if all 
AC generators fail. Of course, the GCUs and BPCU take the 
appropriate actions to disconnect defective units and continue 
to feed essential AC loads using inverter power.

To produce DC power, AC bus 1 sends current to its 
transformer rectifier (TR), TR 1 (center left of Figure 9-104). 
The TR unit is used to change AC to DC. The TR contains 
a transformer to step down the voltage from 115-volt AC to 
26-volt AC and a rectifier to change the 26-volt AC to 26-
volt DC. The output of the TR is therefore compatible with 
the aircraft battery at 26-volt DC. Since DC power is not 
phase sensitive, the DC buses are connected during normal 
operation. In the event of a bus problem, the BPCU may 
isolate one or more DC buses to ensure correct distribution 
of DC power. This aircraft contains two batteries that are 
used to supply emergency DC power.

Figure 9-105. Parallel power distribution system.

Parallel Systems

Multiengine aircraft, such as the Boeing 727, MD-11, and 
the early Boeing 747, employ a parallel power distribution 
system. During normal flight conditions, all engine-driven 
generators connect together and power the AC loads. In this 
configuration, the generators are operated in parallel; hence 
the name parallel power distribution system. In a parallel 
system, all generator output current must be phase regulated. 
Before generators are connected to the same bus, their output 
frequency must be adjusted to ensure the AC output reaches 
the positive and negative peaks simultaneously. During the 
flight, generators must maintain this in-phase condition for 
proper operation. 

One advantage of parallel systems is that in the event of a 
generator failure, the buses are already connected and the 
defective generator need only be isolated from the system. 
A paralleling bus, or synchronizing bus, is used to connect 
the generators during flight. The synchronizing bus is often 
referred to as the sync bus. Most of these systems are less 
automated and require that flight crew monitor systems and 
manually control bus contactors. BTBs are operated by the 

flight crew through the electrical control panel and used to 
connect all necessary buses. GBs are used to connect and 
disconnect the generators.

Figure 9-105 shows a simplified parallel power distribution 
system. This aircraft employs three main-engine driven 
generators and one APU generator. The APU (bottom right) 
is not operational in flight and cannot provide backup power. 
The APU generator is for ground operations only. The three 
main generators (bottom of Figure 9-105) are connected to 
their respective AC bus through GBs one, two, and three. 
The AC buses are connected to the sync bus through three 
BTBs. In this manner, all three generators share the entire AC 
electrical loads. Keep in mind, all generators connected to 
the sync bus must be in phase. If a generator fails, the flight 
crew would simply isolate the defective generator and the 
flight would continue without interruption. 

The number one and two DC buses (Figure 9-105 top left) 
are used to feed the DC electrical loads of the aircraft. DC 
bus 1 receives power form AC bus 1 though TR1. DC bus 
2 is fed in a similar manner from AC bus 2. The DC buses

also connect to the battery bus and eventually to the battery. 
The essential DC bus (top left) can be fed from DC bus 1 
or the essential TR. A diode prevents the essential DC bus 
from powering DC bus 1. The essential DC bus receives 
power from the essential TR, which receives power from the 
essential AC bus. This provides an extra layer of redundancy 
since the essential AC bus can be isolated and fed from any 
main generator. Figure 9-105 shows generator 3 powering 
the essential AC bus. 

Split-Parallel Systems

A split-parallel bus basically employs the best of both split- 
bus and the parallel-bus systems. The split-parallel system 
is found on the Boeing 747-400 and contains four generators 
driven by the main engines and two APU-driven generators. 
The system can operate with all generators in parallel, or 
the generators can be operated independently as in a split- 
bus system. During a normal flight, all four engine-driven 
generators are operated in parallel. The system is operated 
in split-bus mode only under certain failure conditions or 
when using external power. The Boeing 747-400 split-
parallel system is computer controlled using four GCU and 
two BPCU. There is one GCU controlling each generator; 
BPCU 1 controls the left side bus power distribution, and 
BPCU 2 controls the right side bus power. The GCUs and 
BPCUs operate similarly to those previously discussed under 
the split-bus system. 

Figure 9-106 shows a simplified split-parallel power 
distribution system. The main generators (top of Figure 9-106) 
are driven by the main turbine engines. Each generator is 
connected to its load bus through a generator control breaker 
(GCB). The generator control unit closes the GCB when the 
pilot calls for generator power and all systems are operating 
normally. Each load bus is connected to various electrical 
systems and additional sub-buses. The BTB are controlled 
by the BPCU and connect each load bus to the left and right 
sync bus. A split systems breaker (SSB) is used to connect 
the left and right sync buses and is closed during a normal 
flight. With the SSB, GCBs, and BTBs, in the closed position 
the generators operate in parallel. When operating in parallel, 
all generators must be in phase. 

If the aircraft electrical system experiences a malfunction, 
the control units make the appropriate adjustments to ensure 
all necessary loads receive electrical power. For example, if 
generator 1 fails, GCU 1 detects the fault and command GCB 
1 to open. With GCB 1 open, load bus 1 now  feeds from 
the sync bus and the three operating generators. In another 
example, if load bus 4 should short to ground, BPCU 4 opens 
the GCB 4 and BTB 4. This isolates the shorted bus (load 
bus 4). All loads on the shorted bus are no longer powered, 
and generator 4 is no longer available. However, with three 
remaining generators operational, the flight continues safely. 
As do all large aircraft, the Boeing 747-400 contains a DC

power distribution system. The DC system is used for battery 
and emergency operations. The DC system is similar to those 
previously discussed, powered by TR units. The TRs are 
connected to the AC buses and convert AC into 26-volt DC. 
The DC power systems are the final backups in the event of 
a catastrophic electrical failure. The systems most critical to 
fly the aircraft can typically receive power from the battery. 
This aircraft also contains two static inverters to provide 
emergency AC power when needed. 

Wiring Installation
Wiring Diagrams 
Electrical wiring diagrams are included in most aircraft 
service manuals and specify information, such as the size 
of the wire and type of terminals to be used for a particular 
application. Furthermore, wiring diagrams typically identify 
each component within a system by its part number and its 
serial number, including any changes that were made during 
the production run of an aircraft. Wiring diagrams are often 
used for troubleshooting electrical malfunctions.

Block Diagrams
A block diagram is used as an aid for troubleshooting complex 
electrical and electronic systems. A block diagram consists of 
individual blocks that represent several components, such as a 
printed circuit board or some other type of replaceable module. 
Figure 9-107 is a block diagram of an aircraft electrical system.

Pictorial Diagrams
In a pictorial diagram, pictures of components are used 
instead of the conventional electrical symbols found 
in schematic diagrams. A pictorial diagram helps the 
maintenance technician visualize the operation of a  
system. [Figure 9-108]

Schematic Diagrams
A schematic diagram is used to illustrate a principle of 
operation, and therefore does not show parts as they actually 
appear or function. [Figure 9-109] However, schematic 
diagrams do indicate the location of components with 
respect to each other. Schematic diagrams are best utilized 
for troubleshooting.

Wire Types
The satisfactory performance of any modern aircraft depends 
to a very great degree on the continuing reliability of electrical 
systems and subsystems. Improperly or carelessly maintained 
wiring can be a source of both immediate and potential 
danger. The continued proper performance of electrical 
systems depends on the knowledge and techniques of the 
technician who installs, inspects, and maintains the electrical 
system wires and cables.

Procedures and practices outlined in this section are general 
recommendations and are not intended to replace the 
manufacturer’s instructions and approved practices.

Figure 9-110. Aircraft electrical cable. 

Figure 9-111. Shielded wire harness. 

Figure 9-112. Aircraft electrical cable.

A wire is described as a single, solid conductor, or as a 
stranded conductor covered with an insulating material. 
Figure 9-110 illustrates these two definitions of a wire. 
Because of in-flight vibration and flexing, conductor round 
wire should be stranded to minimize fatigue breakage.

The term “cable,” as used in aircraft electrical installations, 
includes:

1. Two or more separately insulated conductors in the 
same jacket.

2. Two or more separately insulated conductors twisted 
together (twisted pair).

3. One or more insulated conductors covered with a 
metallic braided shield (shielded cable).

4. A single insulated center conductor with a metallic 
braided outer conductor (radio frequency cable). 

The term “wire harness” is used when an array of insulated 
conductors are bound together by lacing cord, metal bands, 
or other binding in an arrangement suitable for use only in 
specific equipment for which the harness was designed; it 
may include terminations. Wire harnesses are extensively 
used in aircraft to connect all the electrical components. 
[Figure 9-111]

For many years, the standard wire in light aircraft has been 
MIL-W-5086A, which uses a tin-coated copper conductor 
rated at 600 volts and temperatures of 105 °C. This basic wire 
is then coated with various insulating coatings. Commercial 
and military aircraft use wire that is manufactured under 
MIL-W-22759 specification, which complies with current 
military and FAA requirements. 

The most important consideration in the selection of aircraft 
wire is properly matching the wire’s construction to the 
application environment. Wire construction that is suitable for 
the most severe environmental condition to be encountered 
should be selected. Wires are typically categorized as being 
suitable for either open wiring or protected wiring application. 
The wire temperature rating is typically a measure of the 
insulation’s ability to withstand the combination of ambient 
temperature and current-related conductor temperature rise.

Conductor
The two most generally used conductors are copper and 
aluminum. Each has characteristics that make its use 
advantageous under certain circumstances. Also, each has 
certain disadvantages. Copper has a higher conductivity; is 
more ductile; has relatively high tensile strength; and can be 
easily soldered. Copper is more expensive and heavier than 
aluminum. Although aluminum has only about 60 percent of 
the conductivity of copper, it is used extensively. Its lightness 
makes possible long spans, and its relatively large diameter 
for a given conductivity reduces corona (the discharge of 
electricity from the wire when it has a high potential). The 
discharge is greater when small diameter wire is used than 
when large diameter wire is used. Some bus bars are made of 
aluminum instead of copper where there is a greater radiating 
surface for the same conductance. The characteristics of 
copper and aluminum are compared in Figure 9-112.


9-68

Figure 9-113. Shielded wire harness for flight control.

Plating
Bare copper develops a surface oxide coating at a rate 
dependent on temperature. This oxide film is a poor conductor 
of electricity and inhibits determination of wire. Therefore, 
all aircraft wiring has a coating of tin, silver, or nickel that 
has far slower oxidation rates.

1. Tin-coated copper is a very common plating material. 
Its ability to be successfully soldered without 
highly active fluxes diminishes rapidly with time 
after manufacture. It can be used up to the limiting 
temperature of 150 °C.

2. Silver-coated wire is used where temperatures do not 
exceed 200 °C (392 °F).

3. Nickel-coated wire retains its properties beyond 
260 °C, but most aircraft wire using such coated 
strands has insulation systems that cannot exceed 
that temperature on long-term exposure. Soldered 
terminations of nickel-plated conductor require the 
use of different solder sleeves or flux than those used 
with tin- or silver-plated conductor.

Insulation
Two fundamental properties of insulation materials are 
insulation resistance and dielectric strength. These are 
entirely different and distinct properties.

Insulation resistance is the resistance to current leakage 
through and over the surface of insulation materials. 
Insulation resistance can be measured with a megohmmeter/
insulation tester without damaging the insulation, and data so 
obtained serves as a useful guide in determining the general 
condition of the insulation. However, the data obtained in 
this manner may not give a true picture of the condition of 
the insulation. Clean, dry insulation having cracks or other 
faults might show a high value of insulation resistance but 
would not be suitable for use.

Dielectric strength is the ability of the insulator to withstand 
potential difference and is usually expressed in terms of 
the voltage at which the insulation fails because of the 
electrostatic stress. Maximum dielectric strength values can 
be measured by raising the voltage of a test sample until the 
insulation breaks down.

The type of conductor insulation material varies with the 
type of installation. Characteristics should be chosen based 
on environment, such as abrasion resistance, arc resistance, 
corrosion resistance, cut-through strength, dielectric strength, 
flame resistant, mechanical strength, smoke emission, fluid 
resistance, and heat distortion. Such types of insulation 
materials (e.g., PVC/nylon, Kapton®, and Teflon®) are 
no longer used for new aircraft designs, but might still 

be installed on older aircraft. Insulation materials for new 
aircraft designs are made of Tefzel®, Teflon®/Kapton®/
Teflon® and PTFE/Polyimide/PTFE. The development of 
better and safer insulation materials is ongoing.

Since electrical wire may be installed in areas where 
inspection is infrequent over extended periods of time, it 
is necessary to give special consideration to heat-aging 
characteristics in the selection of wire. Resistance to heat is 
of primary importance in the selection of wire for aircraft 
use, as it is the basic factor in wire rating. Where wire may 
be required to operate at higher temperatures due either 
to high ambient temperatures, high current loading, or a 
combination of the two, selection should be made on the 
basis of satisfactory performance under the most severe 
operating conditions.

Wire Shielding
With the increase in number of highly sensitive electronic 
devices found on modern aircraft, it has become very 
important to ensure proper shielding for many electric circuits. 
Shielding is the process of applying a metallic covering 
to wiring and equipment to eliminate electromagnetic 
interference (EMI). EMI is caused when electromagnetic 
fields (radio waves) induce high frequency (HF) voltages in 
a wire or component. The induced voltage can cause system 
inaccuracies or even failure.

Use of shielding with 85 percent coverage or greater is 
recommended. Coaxial, triaxial, twinaxial, or quadraxial 
cables should be used, wherever appropriate, with their 
shields connected to ground at a single point or multiple 
points, depending upon the purpose of the shielding. 
[Figure 9-113] The airframe grounded structure may also 
be used as an EMI shield.


9-69

Figure 9-114. Wire harness with protective jacket.

Wire Substitutions
When a replacement wire is required in the repair and 
modification of existing aircraft, the maintenance manual 
for that aircraft must first be reviewed to determine if the 
original aircraft manufacturer (OAM) has approved any 
substitution. If not, then the manufacturer must be contacted 
for an acceptable replacement.

Areas Designated as Severe Wind and Moisture 
Problem (SWAMP) 
SWAMP areas differ from aircraft to aircraft but are usually  
wheel wells, near wing flaps, wing folds, pylons, and other 
exterior areas that may have a harsh environment. Wires 
in these areas have often an exterior jacket to protect them 
from the environment. Wires for these applications often 
have design features incorporated into their construction 
that may make the wire unique; therefore, an acceptable 
substitution may be difficult, if not impossible, to find. It 
is very important to use the wire type recommended in the 
aircraft manufacturer’s maintenance handbook. Insulation or 
jacketing varies according to the environment. [Figure 9-114]

Wire Size Selection
Wire is manufactured in sizes according to a standard 
known as the American wire gauge (AWG). As shown in 
Figure 9-115, the wire diameters become smaller as the 
gauge numbers become larger. Typical wire sizes range from 
a number 40 to number 0000. 

Gauge numbers are useful in comparing the diameter of wires, 
but not all types of wire or cable can be measured accurately 
with a gauge. Larger wires are usually stranded to increase 
their flexibility. In such cases, the total area can be determined 
by multiplying the area of one strand (usually computed in 
circular mils when diameter or gauge number is known) by 
the number of strands in the wire or cable.

Several factors must be considered in selecting the size of 
wire for transmitting and distributing electric power.

1. Wires must have sufficient mechanical strength to 
allow for service conditions.

2. Allowable power loss (I2 R loss) in the line represents 
electrical energy converted into heat. The use of large 
conductors reduces the resistance and therefore the I2 
R loss. However, large conductors are more expensive, 
heavier, and need more substantial support.

3. If the source maintains a constant voltage at the input 
to the lines, any variation in the load on the line causes 
a variation in line current and a consequent variation 
in the IR drop in the line. A wide variation in the IR 
drop in the line causes poor voltage regulation at the 
load. The obvious remedy is to reduce either current 
or resistance. A reduction in load current lowers 
the amount of power being transmitted, whereas a 
reduction in line resistance increases the size and 
weight of conductors required. A compromise is 
generally reached whereby the voltage variation at 
the load is within tolerable limits and the weight of 
line conductors is not excessive.

4. When current is drawn through the conductor, heat is 
generated. The temperature of the wire rises until the 
heat radiated, or otherwise dissipated, is equal to the 
heat generated by the passage of current through the 
line. If the conductor is insulated, the heat generated 
in the conductor is not so readily removed as it 
would be if the conductor were not insulated. Thus, 
to protect the insulation from too much heat, the 
current through the conductor must be maintained 
below a certain value. When electrical conductors are 
installed in locations where the ambient temperature 
is relatively high, the heat generated by external 
sources constitutes an appreciable part of the total 
conductor heating. Allowance must be made for 
the influence of external heating on the allowable 
conductor current, and each case has its own specific 
limitations. The maximum allowable operating 
temperature of insulated conductors varies with the 
type of conductor insulation being used.

If it is desirable to use wire sizes smaller than #20, particular 
attention should be given to the mechanical strength and 
installation handling of these wires (e.g., vibration, flexing, 
and termination). Wires containing less than 19 strands 
must not be used. Consideration should be given to the use 
of high-strength alloy conductors in small-gauge wires to 
increase mechanical strength. As a general practice, wires 
smaller than size #20 should be provided with additional 
clamps and be grouped with at least three other wires. They 
should also have additional support at terminations, such 
as connector grommets, strain relief clamps, shrinkable 
sleeving, or telescoping bushings. They should not be used in

applications where they are subjected to excessive vibration, 
repeated bending, or frequent disconnection from screw 
termination. [Figure 9-116]

Current Carrying Capacity
In some instances, the wire may be capable of carrying more 
current than is recommended for the contacts of the related 
connector. In this instance, it is the contact rating that dictates 
the maximum current to be carried by a wire. Wires of larger 
gauge may need to be used to fit within the crimp range of 
connector contacts that are adequately rated for the current 
being carried. Figure 9-117 gives a family of curves whereby 
the bundle derating factor may be obtained.

Maximum Operating Temperature

The current that causes a temperature steady state condition 
equal to the rated temperature of the wire should not be 
exceeded. Rated temperature of the wire may be based 
upon the ability of either the conductor or the insulation to 
withstand continuous operation without degradation.

1. Single Wire in Free Air
Determining a wiring system’s current-carrying capacity 
begins with determining the maximum current that a 
given-sized wire can carry without exceeding the allowable 
temperature difference (wire rating minus ambient °C). 
The curves are based upon a single copper wire in free air. 
[Figure 9-117]

2. Wires in a Harness
When wires are bundled into harnesses, the current derived 
for a single wire must be reduced, as shown in Figure 9-118. 
The amount of current derating is a function of the number 
of wires in the bundle and the percentage of the total wire 
bundle capacity that is being used. 

3. Harness at Altitude 
Since heat loss from the bundle is reduced with increased 
altitude, the amount of current should be derated. 
Figure 9-119 gives a curve whereby the altitude-derating 
factor may be obtained.

4. Aluminum Conductor Wire
When aluminum conductor wire is used, sizes should be 
selected on the basis of current ratings shown in Figure 9-120. 
The use of sizes smaller than #8 is discouraged. Aluminum 
wire should not be attached to engine mounted accessories 
or used in areas having corrosive fumes, severe vibration, 
mechanical stresses, or where there is a need for frequent 
disconnection. Use of aluminum wire is also discouraged 
for runs of less than 3 feet. Termination hardware should 
be of the type specifically designed for use with aluminum 
conductor wiring. 

Computing Current Carrying Capacity

The following section presents some examples on how to 
calculate the load carrying capacity of aircraft electrical 
wire. The calculation is a step by step approach and several 
graphs are used to obtain information to compute the current 
carrying capacity of a particular wire.

Example 1
Assume a harness (open or braided) consisting of 10 wires, 
size 20, 200 °C rated copper, and 25 wires size 22, 200 °C 
rated copper, is installed in an area where the ambient 
temperature is 60 °C and the aircraft is capable of operating 
at a 35,000 foot altitude. Circuit analysis reveals that 7 of the 
35 wires in the bundle (7⁄35 = 20 percent) are carrying power 
currents near or up to capacity.

Step 1—Refer to the single wire in free air curves in 
Figure 9-114. Determine the change of temperature of the wire 
to determine free air ratings. Since the wire is in an ambient 
temperature of 60 °C and rated at 200 °C, the change of the 
temperature is 200 °C – 60 °C = 140 °C. Follow the 140 °C 
temperature difference horizontally until it intersects with 
wire size line on Figure 9-113. The free air rating for size 20 
is 21.5 amps, and the free air rating for size 22 is 16.2 amps.

Step 2—Refer to the bundle derating curves in Figure 9-118. 
The 20 percent curve is selected since circuit analysis indicate 
that 20 percent or less of the wire in the harness would be 
carrying power currents and less than 20 percent of the bundle 
capacity would be used. Find 35 (on the horizontal axis), since 
there are 35 wires in the bundle, and determine a derating 
factor of 0.52 (on the vertical axis) from the 20 percent curve.

Step 3—Derate the size 22 free air rating by multiplying 16.2 
by 0.52 to get 8.4 amps in harness rating. Derate the size 20 
free air rating by multiplying 21.5 by 0.52 to get 11.2 amps 
in-harness rating.

Step 4—Refer to the altitude derating curve of Figure 9-119.
Look for 35,000 feet (on the horizontal axis) since that is the 
altitude at which the aircraft is operating. Note that the wire 
must be derated by a factor of 0.86 (found on the vertical 
axis). Derate the size 22 harness rating by multiplying 8.4 
amps by 0.86 to get 7.2 amps. Derate the size 20 harness 
rating by multiplying 11.2 amps by 0.86 to get 9.6 amps.

Step 5—To find the total harness capacity, multiply the 
total number of size 22 wires by the derated capacity 
(25 × 7.2 = 180.0 amps) and add to that the number of size 20 
wires multiplied by the derated capacity (10 × 9.6  = 96.8 amps) 
and multiply the sum by the 20 percent harness capacity factor. 
Thus, the total harness capacity is (180.0 + 96.0) × 0.20  = 55.2 
amps. It has been determined that the total harness

Length (LI) is based on conductor temperature of 20 °C. 
To determine length (L2) at a higher conductor temperature, 
use formula in which T2 = estimated conductor temperature °C.

bus and utilization equipment ground).

current should not exceed 55.2 A, size 22 wire should not 
carry more than 7.2 amps and size 20 wire should not carry 
more than 9.6 amps.

Step 6—Determine the actual circuit current for each wire in 
the bundle and for the whole bundle. If the values calculated 
in step 5 are exceeded, select the next larger size wire and 
repeat the calculations.

Example 2
Assume a harness (open or braided), consisting of 12 size 
12, 200 °C rated copper wires, is operated in an ambient 
temperature of 25 °C at sea level and 60 °C at a 20,000-
foot altitude. All 12 wires are operated at or near their  
maximum capacity.

Step 1—Refer to the single wire in free air curve in 
Figure 9-117, determine the temperature difference of the 
wire to determine free air ratings. Since the wire is in ambient 
temperature of 25 °C and 60 °C and is rated at 200 °C, the 
temperature differences are 200 °C – 25 °C = 175 °C and 
200 °C – 60 °C = 140 °C, respectively. Follow the 175 °C 
and the 140 °C temperature difference lines on Figure 9-116 
until each intersects wire size line. The free air ratings of size 
12 are 68 amps and 59 amps, respectively.

Step 2—Refer to the bundling derating curves in Figure 9-118. 
The 100 percent curve is selected because we know all 12 
wires are carrying full load. Find 12 (on the horizontal 
axis) since there are 12 wires in the bundle and determine 
a derating factor of 0.43 (on the vertical axis) from the 100 
percent curve.

Step 3—Derate the size #12 free air ratings by multiplying 
68 amps and 61 amps by 0.43 to get 29.2 amps and 25.4 
amps, respectively.

Step 4—Refer to the altitude derating curve of Figure 9-119, 
look for sea level and 20,000 feet (on the horizontal axis) 
since these are the conditions at which the load is carried. The 
wire must be derated by a factor of 1.0 and 0.91, respectively.

Step 5—Derate the size 12 in a bundle ratings by multiplying 
29.2 amps at sea level and 25.4 amps at 20,000 feet by 1.0 
and 0.91, respectively to obtain 29.2 amps and 23.1 amps. 
The total bundle capacity at sea level and 25 °C ambient 
temperature is 29.2 × 12 = 350.4 amps. At 20,000 feet 
and 60 °C ambient temperature, the bundle capacity is 
23.1 × 12 = 277.2 amps. Each size 12 wire can carry 29.2 
amps at sea level, 25 °C ambient temperature or 23.1 amps 
at 20,000 feet and 60 °C ambient temperature.

Step 6—Determine the actual circuit current for each wire 
in the bundle and for the bundle. If the values calculated 
in Step 5 are exceeded, select the next larger size wire and 
repeat the calculations.

Allowable Voltage Drop
The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation 
source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent 
of the regulated voltage when the generator is carrying rated 
current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate. 
The tabulation shown in Figure 9-121 defines the maximum 
acceptable voltage drop in the load circuits between the bus 
and the utilization equipment ground. 

The resistance of the current return path through the aircraft 
structure is generally considered negligible. However, this 
is based on the assumption that adequate bonding to the 
structure or a special electric current return path has been 
provided that is capable of carrying the required electric 
current with a negligible voltage drop. To determine circuit 
resistance, check the voltage drop across the circuit. If the 
voltage drop does not exceed the limit established by the 
aircraft or product manufacturer, the resistance value for 
the circuit may be considered satisfactory. When checking a 
circuit, the input voltage should be maintained at a constant 
value. Figures 9-122 and 9-123 show formulas that may be 
used to determine electrical resistance in wires and some 
typical examples.

Electric Wire Chart Instructions

To select the correct size of electrical wire, two major 
requirements must be met:

1. The wire size should be sufficient to prevent an 
excessive voltage drop while carrying the required 
current over the required distance. [Figure 9-121]

2. The size should be sufficient to prevent overheating of 
the wire carrying the required current. (See Maximum 
Operating Temperature earlier in this chapter for 
computing current carrying capacity methods.)

To meet the two requirements for selecting the correct wire 
size using Figure 9-116, the following must be known:

1. The wire length in feet.

2. The number of amperes of current to be carried.

3. The allowable voltage drop permitted.

4. The required continuous or intermittent current.

5. The estimated or measured conductor temperature.

6. Is the wire to be installed in conduit and/or bundle?

7. Is the wire to be installed as a single wire in free air?

Example A. 
Find the wire size in Figure 9-116 using the following known 
information:

1. The wire run is 50 feet long, including the ground 
wire.

2. Current load is 20 amps.

3. The voltage source is 28 volts from bus to equipment.

4. The circuit has continuous operation.

5. Estimated conductor temperature is 20 °C or less. The 
scale on the left of the chart represents maximum wire 
length in feet to prevent an excessive voltage drop for 
a specified voltage source system (e.g., 14V, 28V, 
115V, 200V). This voltage is identified at the top of 
scale and the corresponding voltage drop limit for 
continuous operation at the bottom. The scale (slant 
lines) on top of the chart represents amperes. The scale 
at the bottom of the chart represents wire gauge.

Step 1—From the left scale, find the wire length 50 feet under 
the 28V source column.

Step 2—Follow the corresponding horizontal line to the right 
until it intersects the slanted line for the 20-amp load.

Step 3—At this point, drop vertically to the bottom of the 
chart. The value falls between No. 8 and No. 10. Select 
the next larger size wire to the right, in this case No. 8. 
This is the smallest size wire that can be used without 
exceeding the voltage drop limit expressed at the bottom of 
the left scale. This example is plotted on the wire chart in 
Figure 9-116. Use Figure 9-116 (top) for continuous flow 
and Figure 9-116 (bottom) for intermittent flow.

Example B. 
Find the wire size in Figure 9-116 using the following known 
information:

1. The wire run is 200 feet long, including the ground 
wire.

3. The voltage source is 115 volts from bus to equipment.

4. The circuit has intermittent operation.

Step 1—From the left scale, find the wire length of 200 feet 
under the 115V source column.

Step 2—Follow the corresponding horizontal line to the right 
until it intersects the slanted line for the 10-amp load.

Step 3—At this point, drop vertically to the bottom of the 
chart. The value falls between No. 16 and No. 14. Select the 
next larger size wire to the right—in this case, No. 14. This is 
the smallest size wire that can be used without exceeding the 
voltage drop limit expressed at the bottom of the left scale. 

Wire Identification
The proper identification of electrical wires and cables 
with their circuits and voltages is necessary to provide 
safety of operation, safety to maintenance personnel, and 
ease of maintenance. All wire used on aircraft must have 
its type identification imprinted along its length. It is 
common practice to follow this part number with the five 
digit/letter Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) 
code identifying the wire manufacturer. You can identify 
the performance capabilities of existing installed wire you 
need to replace, and avoid the inadvertent use of a lower 
performance and unsuitable replacement wire. 

Placement of Identification Markings
Identification markings should be placed at each end of the 
wire and at 15-inch maximum intervals along the length 
of the wire. Wires less than 3 inches in length need not be 

identified. Wires 3 to 7 inches in length should be identified 
approximately at the center. Added identification marker 
sleeves should be located so that ties, clamps, or supporting 
devices need not be removed to read the identification. The 
wire identification code must be printed to read horizontally 
(from left to right) or vertically (from top to bottom). The two 
methods of marking wire or cable are as follows:

1. Direct marking is accomplished by printing the cable’s 
outer covering. [Figure 9-124B]

2. Indirect marking is accomplished by printing a heat-
shrinkable sleeve and installing the printed sleeve on 
the wire or cables outer covering. Indirectly-marked 
wire or cable should be identified with printed 
sleeves at each end and at intervals not longer than 
6 feet. [Figure 9-125] The individual wires inside 
a cable should be identified within 3 inches of their 
termination. [Figure 9-124A]

Types of Wire Markings 
The preferred method is to mark directly on the wire without 
causing insulation degradation. Teflon-coated wires, shielded 
wiring, multiconductor cable, and thermocouple wires 
usually require special sleeves to carry identification marks. 
There are some special wire marking machines available that 
can be used to stamp directly on the type wires mentioned 
above. Whatever method of marking is used, the marking 
should be legible and the color should contrast with the wire 
insulation or sleeve.

Several different methods can be used to mark directly on 
the wire: hot stamp marking, ink jet printers, and laser jet 
printers. [Figure 9-126] The hot stamp method can damage 
the insulation of a newer type of wire that utilizes thin

insulators. Fracture of the insulation wall and penetration to 
the conductor of these materials by the stamping dies have 
occurred. Later in service, when these openings have been 
wetted by various fluids or moisture, serious arcing and 
surface tracking have damaged wire bundles.

Identification sleeves can be used if the direct marking on 
the wire is not possible. [Figure 9-127]

Flexible sleeving, either clear or opaque, is satisfactory for 
general use. When color-coded or striped component wire is 

used as part of a cable, the identification sleeve should specify 
which color is associated with each wire identification code. 
Identification sleeves are normally used for identifying the 
following types of wire or cable: unjacketed shielded wire, 
thermocouple wire, coaxial cable, multiconductor cable, 
and high temperature wire. In most cases, identification tape 
can be used in place of sleeving. For sleeving exposed to 
high temperatures (over 400 °F), materials, such as silicone 
fiberglass, should be used. Polyolefin sleeving should be used 
in areas where resistance to solvent and synthetic hydraulic 
fluids is necessary. Sleeves may be secured in place with 
cable ties or by heat shrinking. The identification sleeving 
for various sizes of wire is shown in Figure 9-128.

Wire Installation and Routing
Open Wiring
Interconnecting wire is used in point-to-point open harnesses, 
normally in the interior or pressurized fuselage, with each 
wire providing enough insulation to resist damage from 
handling and service exposure. Electrical wiring is often 
installed in aircraft without special enclosing means. This 
practice is known as open wiring and offers the advantages 
of ease of maintenance and reduced weight.

Wire Groups and Bundles and Routing
Wires are often installed in bundles to create a more organized 
installation. These wire bundles are often called wire 
harnesses. Wire harnesses are often made in the factory or

electrical shop on a jig board so that the wire bundles could be 
preformed to fit into the aircraft. [Figure 9-129] As a result, 
each harness for a particular aircraft installation is identical in 
shape and length. The wiring harness could be covered by a 
shielding (metal braid) to avoid EMI. Grouping or bundling 
certain wires, such as electrically unprotected power wiring 
and wiring going to duplicate vital equipment, should be 
avoided. Wire bundles should generally be less than 75 wires, 
or 11⁄2 to 2 inches in diameter where practicable. When several 
wires are grouped at junction boxes, terminal blocks, panels, 
etc., identity of the groups within a bundle can be retained.



Slack in Wire Bundles

Wiring should be installed with sufficient slack so that 
bundles and individual wires are not under tension. Wires 
connected to movable or shock-mounted equipment should 
have sufficient length to allow full travel without tension 
on the bundle. Wiring at terminal lugs or connectors should 
have sufficient slack to allow two reterminations without 
replacement of wires. This slack should be in addition to 
the drip loop and the allowance for movable equipment. 
Normally, wire groups or bundles should not exceed 1⁄2 inch 
deflection between support points. [Figure 9-130] This 
measurement may be exceeded if there is no possibility of 
the wire group or bundle touching a surface that may cause 
abrasion. Sufficient slack should be provided at each end to 
permit replacement of terminals and ease of maintenance; 
prevent mechanical strain on the wires, cables, junctions, 
and supports; permit free movement of shock- and vibration-
mounted equipment; and allow shifting of equipment, as 
necessary, to perform alignment, servicing, tuning, removal 
of dust covers, and changing of internal components while 
installed in aircraft.

Twisting Wires

When specified on the engineering drawing, or when 
accomplished as a local practice, parallel wires must 
sometimes be twisted. The following are the most  
common examples:

1. Wiring in the vicinity of magnetic compass or flux 
valve

2. Three-phase distribution wiring

3. Certain other wires (usually radio wiring) as specified 
on engineering drawings

Twist the wires so they lie snugly against each other, making 
approximately the number of twists per foot as shown in 
Figure 9-131. Always check wire insulation for damage after 
twisting. If the insulation is torn or frayed, replace the wire.

Spliced Connections in Wire Bundles

Splicing is permitted on wiring as long as it does not affect 
the reliability and the electromechanical characteristics of 
the wiring. Splicing of power wires, coaxial cables, multiplex 
bus, and large-gauge wire must have approved data. Splicing 
of electrical wire should be kept to a minimum and avoided 
entirely in locations subject to extreme vibrations. Splicing 
of individual wires in a group or bundle should have 
engineering approval, and the splice(s) should be located 
to allow periodic inspection.

Many types of aircraft splice connector are available for 
use when splicing individual wires. Use of a self-insulated 
splice connector is preferred; however, a non-insulated 
splice connector may be used provided the splice is 
covered with plastic sleeving that is secured at both ends. 
Environmentally sealed splices that conform to MIL-T-7928 
provide a reliable means of splicing in SWAMP areas. 
However, a non-insulated splice connector may be used, 
provided the splice is covered with dual-wall shrink sleeving 
of a suitable material.

There should be no more than one splice in any one wire 
segment between any two connectors or other disconnect 
points. Exceptions include when attaching to the spare 
pigtail lead of a potted connector, when splicing multiple 
wires to a single wire, when adjusting wire size to fit 
connector contact crimp barrel size, and when required to 
make an approved repair. 

Splices in bundles must be staggered to minimize any 
increase in the size of the bundle, preventing the bundle from 
fitting into its designated space or causing congestion that 
adversely affects maintenance. [Figure 9-132]

Splices should not be used within 12 inches of a termination 

device, except when attaching to the pigtail spare lead of a 
potted termination device, to splice multiple wires to a single 
wire, or to adjust the wire sizes so that they are compatible 
with the contact crimp barrel sizes.

Bend Radii

The minimum radius of bends in wire groups or bundles must 
not be less than 10 times the outside diameter of the largest wire 
or cable, except that at the terminal strips where wires break 
out at terminations or reverse direction in a bundle. Where 
the wire is suitably supported, the radius may be three times 
the diameter of the wire or cable. Where it is not practical to 
install wiring or cables within the radius requirements, the 
bend should be enclosed in insulating tubing. The radius for 
thermocouple wire should be done in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s recommendation and shall be sufficient to 
avoid excess losses or damage to the cable. Ensure that RF 
cables (e.g., coaxial and triaxial) are bent at a radius of no less 
than six times the outside diameter of the cable.

Protection Against Chafing

Wires and wire groups should be protected against chafing or 
abrasion in those locations where contact with sharp surfaces 
or other wires would damage the insulation, or chafing could 
occur against the airframe or other components. Damage 
to the insulation can cause short circuits, malfunction, or 
inadvertent operation of equipment. 

Protection Against High Temperature

Wiring must be routed away from high-temperature 
equipment and lines to prevent deterioration of insulation. 
Wires must be rated so the conductor temperature remains 
within the wire specification maximum when the ambient 
temperature and heat rise related to current-carrying capacity 
are taken into account. The residual heating effects caused by 
exposure to sunlight when aircraft are parked for extended 
periods should also be taken into account. Wires, such as 
those used in fire detection, fire extinguishing, fuel shutoff, 
and fly-by-wire flight control systems that must operate 
during and after a fire, must be selected from types that are 
qualified to provide circuit integrity after exposure to fire for

a specified period. Wire insulation deteriorates rapidly when 
subjected to high temperatures. 

Separate wires from high-temperature equipment, such as 
resistors, exhaust stacks, heating ducts, to prevent insulation 
breakdown. Insulate wires that must run through hot areas 
with a high-temperature insulation material, such as fiberglass 
or PTFE. Avoid high-temperature areas when using cables 
with soft plastic insulation, such as polyethylene, because 
these materials are subject to deterioration and deformation 
at elevated temperatures. Many coaxial cables have this type 
of insulation.

Protection Against Solvents and Fluids

An arcing fault between an electrical wire and a metallic 
flammable fluid line may puncture the line and result in a fire. 
Every effort must be made to avoid this hazard by physical 
separation of the wire from lines and equipment containing 
oxygen, oil, fuel, hydraulic fluid, or alcohol. Wiring must 
be routed above these lines and equipment with a minimum 
separation of 6 inches or more whenever possible. When such 
an arrangement is not practicable, wiring must be routed so 
that it does not run parallel to the fluid lines. A minimum of 
2 inches must be maintained between wiring and such lines 
and equipment, except when the wiring is positively clamped 
to maintain at least 1⁄2-inch separation, or when it must be 
connected directly to the fluid-carrying equipment. Install 
clamps as shown in Figure 9-133. These clamps should not 
be used as a means of supporting the wire bundle. Additional 
clamps should be installed to support the wire bundle and 
the clamps fastened to the same structure used to support the 
fluid line(s) to prevent relative motion.
Wires, or groups of wires, should enter a junction  box, or 

terminate at a piece of equipment in an upward direction 
where practicable. Ensure that a trap, or drip loop, is provided 
to prevent fluids or condensation from running into wire or 
cable ends that slope downward toward a connector, terminal 
block, panel, or junction block. A drip loop is an area where 
the wire(s) are made to travel downward and then up to the 
connector. [Figure 9-134] Fluids and moisture will flow 
along the wires to the bottom of the loop and be trapped there 
to drip or evaporate without affecting electrical conductivity 
in the wire, junction, or connected device.

Where wires must be routed downwards to a junction box 
or electrical unit and a drip loop is not possible, the entrance 
should be sealed according to manufacturer’s specifications 
to prevent moisture from entering the box/unit. Wires and 
cables installed in bilges and other locations where fluids 
collect must  be routed as far from the lowest point as possible 
or otherwise be provided with a moisture-proof covering.

Protection of Wires in Wheel Well Areas

Wires located on landing gear and in the wheel well area 
can be exposed to many hazardous conditions if not suitably 
protected. Where wire bundles pass flex points, there must not 
be any strain on attachments or excessive slack when parts 
are fully extended or retracted. The wiring and protective 
tubing must be inspected frequently and replaced at the first 
sign of wear.

Wires should be routed so that fluids drain away from the 
connectors. When this is not practicable, connectors must be 
potted. Wiring which must be routed in wheel wells or other 
external areas must be given extra protection in the form of 
harness jacketing and connector strain relief. Conduits or 
flexible sleeving used to protect wiring must be equipped 
with drain holes to prevent entrapment of moisture.

The technician should check during inspections that wires 
and cables are adequately protected in wheel wells and other 
areas where they may be exposed to damage from impact of 
rocks, ice, mud, etc. (If rerouting of wires or cables is not 
practical, protective jacketing may be installed). This type 
of installation must be held to a minimum.

Clamp Installation

Wires and wire bundles must be supported by clamps or 
plastic cable straps. [Figure 9-135] Clamps and other primary 
support devices must be constructed of materials that are 
compatible with their installation and environment, in terms 
of temperature, fluid resistance, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) 
light, and wire bundle mechanical loads. They should be 
spaced at intervals not exceeding 24 inches. Clamps on wire 
bundles should be selected so that they have a snug fit without 
pinching wires [Figures 9-136 through 9-138]

Caution: The use of metal clamps on coaxial RF cables may 
cause problems, if clamp fit is such that RF cable’s original 
cross section is distorted.

Clamps on wire bundles should not allow the bundle to 
move through the clamp when a slight axial pull is applied. 
Clamps on RF cables must fit without crushing and must 
be snug enough to prevent the cable from moving freely 
through the clamp, but may allow the cable to slide through 
the clamp when a light axial pull is applied. The cable or wire 
bundle may be wrapped with one or more turns of electrical 
tape when required to achieve this fit. Plastic clamps or 
cable ties must not be used where their failure could result 
in interference with movable controls, wire bundle contact 
with movable equipment, or chafing damage to essential or 
unprotected wiring. They must not be used on vertical runs 
where inadvertent slack migration could result in chafing or 
other damage. Clamps must be installed with their attachment 
hardware positioned above them, wherever practicable, so 
that they are unlikely to rotate as the result of wire bundle 
weight or wire bundle chafing. [Figure 9-136]

Figure 9-138. Installing cable clamp to structure.

Clamps lined with nonmetallic material should be used to 
support the wire bundle along the run. Tying may be used 
between clamps, but should not be considered as a substitute 
for adequate clamping. Adhesive tapes are subject to age 
deterioration and, therefore, are not acceptable as a clamping 
means. [Figure 9-137]

The back of the clamp, whenever practical, should be rested 
against a structural member. [Figure 9-138] Stand-offs 
should be used to maintain clearance between the wires and 
the structure. Clamps must be installed in such a manner 
that the electrical wires do not come in contact with other 
parts of the aircraft when subjected to vibration. Sufficient 
slack should be left between the last clamp and the electrical 
equipment to prevent strain at the terminal and to minimize 
adverse effects on shock-mounted equipment. Where wires 
or wire bundles pass through bulkheads or other structural 
members, a grommet or suitable clamp should be provided 
to prevent abrasion.

When a wire bundle is clamped into position, if there is less 
than 3⁄8-inch of clearance between the bulkhead cutout and 
the wire bundle, a suitable grommet should be installed as 
indicated in Figure 9-139. The grommet may be cut at a 45° 
angle to facilitate installation, provided it is cemented in place 
and the slot is located at the top of the cutout.

Wire and Cable Clamp Inspection 

Inspect wire and cable clamps for proper tightness. Where 
cables pass through structure or bulkheads, inspect for proper 
clamping and grommets. Inspect for sufficient slack between 
the last clamp and the electronic equipment to prevent strain 
at the cable terminals and to minimize adverse effects on 
shock-mounted equipment. Wires and cables are supported 
by suitable clamps, grommets, or other devices at intervals of 
not more than 24 inches, except when contained in troughs, 

ducts, or conduits. The supporting devices should be of a 
suitable size and type, with the wires and cables held securely 
in place without damage to the insulation.

Use metal stand-offs to maintain clearance between wires and 
structure. Tape or tubing is not acceptable as an alternative to 
stand-offs for maintaining clearance. Install phenolic blocks, 
plastic liners, or rubber grommets in holes, bulkheads, floors, 
or structural members where it is impossible to install off-
angle clamps to maintain wiring separation. In such cases, 
additional protection in the form of plastic or insulating tape 
may be used.

Properly secure clamp retaining bolts so the movement of 
wires and cables is restricted to the span between the points 
of support and not on soldered or mechanical connections at 
terminal posts or connectors.

Movable Controls Wiring Precautions

Clamping of wires routed near movable flight controls 
must be attached with steel hardware and must be spaced 
so that failure of a single attachment point cannot result in 
interference with controls. The minimum separation between 
wiring and movable controls must be at least 1⁄2 inch when 
the bundle is displaced by light hand pressure in the direction 
of the controls.

Conduit
Conduit is manufactured in metallic and nonmetallic 
materials and in both rigid and flexible forms. Primarily, 
its purpose is for mechanical protection of cables or wires. 
Conduit size should be selected for a specific wire bundle 
application to allow for ease in maintenance, and possible 
future circuit expansion, by specifying the conduit inner 
diameter (ID) about 25 percent larger than the maximum 
diameter of the wire bundle. [Figure 9-140]

Conduit problems can be avoided by following these 
guidelines:

• Do not locate conduit where passengers or maintenance 
personnel might use it as a handhold or footstep.

• Provide drain holes at the lowest point in a conduit 
run. Drilling burrs should be carefully removed.

• Support conduit to prevent chafing against structure 
and to avoid stressing its end fittings.

Rigid Conduit

Damaged conduit sections should be repaired to preclude 
injury to the wires or wire bundle that may consume as much 
as 80 percent of the tube area. Minimum acceptable tube bend

radii for rigid conduit are shown in Figure 9-141. Kinked or 
wrinkled bends in rigid conduits are not recommended and 
should be replaced. Tubing bends that have been flattened 
into an ellipse and have a minor diameter of less than 75 
percent of the nominal tubing diameter should be replaced, 
because the tube area has been reduced by at least 10 percent. 
Tubing that has been formed and cut to final length should be 
deburred to prevent wire insulation damage. When installing 
replacement tube sections with fittings at both ends, care 
should be taken to eliminate mechanical strain.

Flexible Conduit

Flexible aluminum conduit conforming to specification 
MIL-C-6136 is available in two types: Type I, bare flexible 
conduit, and Type II, rubber-covered flexible conduit. Flexible 
brass conduit conforming to specification MIL-C-7931 is 
available and normally used instead of flexible aluminum 
where necessary to minimize radio interference. Also available 
is a plastic flexible tubing. (Reference MIL-T-8191A.) Flexible 
conduit may be used where it is impractical to use rigid conduit, 
such as areas that have motion between conduit ends or where 
complex bends are necessary.

The use of transparent adhesive tape is recommended when 
cutting flexible tubing with a hacksaw to minimize fraying 
of the braid. The tape should be centered over the cutting 
reference mark with the saw cutting through the tape. After 
cutting the flexible conduit, the transparent tape should be 
removed, the frayed braid ends trimmed, burrs removed from 
inside the conduit, and coupling nut and ferrule installed. 
Minimum acceptable bending radii for flexible conduit are 
shown in Figure 9-142.

Wire Shielding
In conventional wiring systems, circuits are shielded 
individually, in pairs, triples, or quads depending on  

each circuit’s shielding requirement called out for in the 
engineering documentation. A wire is normally shielded 
when it is anticipated that the circuit can be affected by 
another circuit in the wire harness. When the wires come 
close together, they can couple enough interference to cause 
a detrimental upset to attached circuitry. This effect is often 
called crosstalk. Wires must come close enough for their 
fields to interact, and they must be in an operating mode 
that produces the crosstalk effect. However, the potential for 
crosstalk is real, and the only way to prevent crosstalk is to 
shield the wire. [Figure 9-143]

Bonding and Grounding

One of the more important factors in the design and 
maintenance of aircraft electrical systems is proper bonding 
and grounding. Inadequate bonding or grounding can lead to 
unreliable operation of systems,  EMI, electrostatic discharge 
damage to sensitive electronics, personnel shock hazard, or 
damage from lightning strike.


9-86

Figure 9-144. Ground wires.

Grounding

Grounding is the process of electrically connecting 
conductive objects to either a conductive structure or some 
other conductive return path for the purpose of safely 
completing either a normal or fault circuit. [Figure 9-144]
If wires carrying return currents from different types of 
sources, such as signals of DC and AC generators, are 
connected to the same ground point or have a common 
connection in the return paths, an interaction of the currents 
occurs. Mixing return currents from various sources should 
be avoided because noise is coupled from one source to 
another and can be a major problem for digital systems. To 
minimize the interaction between various return currents, 
different types of ground should be identified and used. As 
a minimum, the design should use three ground types: (1) 
AC returns, (2) DC returns, and (3) all others.

For distributed power systems, the power return point for an 
alternative power source would be separated. For example, 
in a two-AC generator (one on the right side and the other on 
the left side) system, if the right AC generator were supplying 
backup power to equipment located in the left side, (left 
equipment rack) the backup AC ground return should be 
labeled “AC Right.” The return currents for the left generator 
should be connected to a ground point labeled “AC Left.”

The design of the ground return circuit should be given as 
much attention as the other leads of a circuit. A requirement 
for proper ground connections is that they maintain an 
impedance that is essentially constant. Ground return circuits 
should have a current rating and voltage drop adequate 
for satisfactory operation of the connected electrical and 
electronic equipment. EMI problems that can be caused by a 
system’s power wire can be reduced substantially by locating 
the associated ground return near the origin of the power 
wiring (e.g., circuit breaker panel) and routing the power 
wire and its ground return in a twisted pair. Special care 

should be exercised to ensure replacement on ground return 
leads. The use of numbered insulated wire leads instead of 
bare grounding jumpers may aid in this respect. In general, 
equipment items should have an external ground connection, 
even when internally grounded. Direct connections to a 
magnesium structure must not be used for ground return 
because they may create a fire hazard.

Power ground connections for generators, transformer 
rectifiers, batteries, external power receptacles, and other 
heavy-current loads must be attached to individual grounding 
brackets that are attached to aircraft structure with a proper 
metal-to-metal bonding attachment. This attachment and the 
surrounding structure must provide adequate conductivity 
to accommodate normal and fault currents of the system 
without creating excessive voltage drop or damage to the 
structure. At least three fasteners, located in a triangular or 
rectangular pattern, must be used to secure such brackets in 
order to minimize susceptibility to loosening under vibration. 
If the structure is fabricated of a material, such as carbon fiber 
composite (CFC), that has a higher resistivity than aluminum 
or copper, it is necessary to provide an alternative ground 
path(s) for power return current. Special attention should be 
considered for composite aircraft.

Power return or fault current ground connections within 
flammable vapor areas must be avoided. If they must be 
made, make sure these connections do not arc, spark, or 
overheat under all possible current flow or mechanical failure 
conditions, including induced lightning currents. Criteria for 
inspection and maintenance to ensure continued airworthiness 
throughout the expected life of the aircraft should be 
established. Power return fault currents are normally the 
highest currents flowing in a structure. These can be the full 
generator current capacity. If full generator fault current flows 
through a localized region of the carbon fiber structure, major 
heating and failure can occur. CFC and other similar low-
resistive materials must not be used in power return paths. 
Additional voltage drops in the return path can cause voltage 
regulation problems. Likewise, repeated localized material 
heating by current surges can cause material degradation. 
Both problems may occur without warning and cause no 
repeatable failures or anomalies.

The use of common ground connections for more than one 
circuit or function should be avoided except where it can be 
shown that related malfunctions that could affect more than 
one circuit do not result in a hazardous condition. Even when 
the loss of multiple systems does not, in itself, create a hazard, 
the effect of such failure can be quite distracting to the crew.

Figure 9-145. Bonding jumpers.

Bonding

Bonding is the electrical connecting of two or more 
conducting objects not otherwise adequately connected.

The following bonding requirements must be considered:

• Equipment bonding—low-impedance paths to 
aircraft structure are normally required for electronic 
equipment to provide radio frequency return circuits 
and for most electrical equipment to facilitate reduction 
in EMI. The cases of components that produce 
electromagnetic energy should be grounded to structure. 
To ensure proper operation of electronic equipment, 
it is particularly important to conform the system’s 
installation specification when interconnections, 
bonding, and grounding are being accomplished.

• Metallic surface bonding—all conducting objects 
on the exterior of the airframe must be electrically 
connected to the airframe through mechanical joints, 
conductive hinges, or bond straps capable of conducting 
static charges and lightning strikes. Exceptions may be 
necessary for some objects, such as antenna elements, 
whose function requires them to be electrically isolated 
from the airframe. Such items should be provided with 
an alternative means to conduct static charges and/or 
lightning currents, as appropriate.

• Static bonds—all isolated conducting parts inside 
and outside the aircraft, having an area greater than 3 
square inches and a linear dimension over 3 inches, 
that are subjected to appreciable electrostatic charging 
due to precipitation, fluid, or air in motion, should 
have a mechanically secure electrical connection to the 
aircraft structure of sufficient conductivity to dissipate 
possible static charges. A resistance of less than 1 ohm 
when clean and dry generally ensures such dissipation 
on larger objects. Higher resistances are permissible 
in connecting smaller objects to airframe structure.

Testing of Bonds and Grounds

The resistance of all bond and ground connections should 
be tested after connections are made before re-finishing. The 
resistance of each connection should normally not exceed 
0.003 ohm. A high quality test instrument, an AN/USM-21A 
or equivalent, is required to accurately measure the very low 
resistance values. 

Bonding Jumper Installation

Bonding jumpers should be made as short as practicable, and 
installed in such a manner that the resistance of each connection 
does not exceed .003 ohm. The jumper should not interfere 
with the operation of movable aircraft elements, such as surface 
controls, nor should normal movement of these elements result 
in damage to the bonding jumper. [Figure 9-145]

• Bonding connections—to ensure a low-resistance 
connection, nonconducting finishes, such as paint 
and anodizing films, should be removed from the 
attachment surface to be contacted by the bonding 
terminal. Electrical wiring should not be grounded 
directly to magnesium parts.

• Corrosion protection—one of the more frequent 
causes of failures in electrical system bonding and 
grounding is corrosion. The areas around completed 
connections should be post-finished quickly with a 
suitable finish coating.

• Corrosion prevention—electrolytic action may 
rapidly corrode a bonding connection if suitable 
precautions are not taken. Aluminum alloy jumpers 
are recommended for most cases; however, copper 
jumpers should be used to bond together parts made 
of stainless steel, cadmium-plated steel, copper, 
brass, or bronze. Where contact between dissimilar 
metals cannot be avoided, the choice of jumper and 
hardware should be such that corrosion is minimized; 
the part likely to corrode should be the jumper or  
associated hardware.

• Bonding jumper attachment—the use of solder to 
attach bonding jumpers should be avoided. Tubular 
members should be bonded by means of clamps to 
which the jumper is attached. Proper choice of clamp 
material should minimize the probability of corrosion.

• Ground return connection—when bonding jumpers 
carry substantial ground return current, the current 
rating of the jumper should be determined to be 
adequate, and a negligible voltage drop is produced.

Lacing and Tying Wire Bundles
Ties, lacing, and straps are used to secure wire groups or 
bundles to provide ease of maintenance, inspection, and 
installation. Straps may not be used in areas of SWAMP, 
such as wheel wells, near wing flaps, or wing folds. They 
may not be used in high vibration areas where failure of the 
strap would permit wiring to move against parts that could 
damage the insulation and foul mechanical linkages or other 
moving mechanical parts. They also may not be used where 
they could be exposed to UV light, unless the straps are 
resistant to such exposure. [Figure 9-147]

Wire Termination
Stripping Wire 
Before wire can be assembled to connectors, terminals, 
splices, etc., the insulation must be stripped from connecting 
ends to expose the bare conductor. Copper wire can be stripped 
in a number of ways depending on the size and insulation. 

Aluminum wire must be stripped using extreme care, since 
individual strands break very easily after being nicked. 
The following general precautions are recommended when 
stripping any type of wire:

1. When using any type of wire stripper, hold the wire 
so that it is perpendicular to cutting blades.

2. Adjust automatic stripping tools carefully; follow the 
manufacturer’s instructions to avoid nicking, cutting, 
or otherwise damaging strands. This is especially 
important for aluminum wires and for copper wires 
smaller than No. 10. Examine stripped wires for 
damage. Cut off and restrip (if length is sufficient), 
or reject and replace any wires having more than the 
allowable number of nicked or broken strands listed 
in the manufacturer’s instructions. 

3. Make sure insulation is clean-cut with no frayed or 
ragged edges. Trim, if necessary.

4. Make sure all insulation is removed from stripped area. 
Some types of wire are supplied with a transparent 
layer of insulation between the conductor and the 
primary insulation. If this is present, remove it. 

5. When using hand-plier strippers to remove lengths of 
insulation longer than 3⁄4 inch, it is easier to accomplish 
in two or more operations.

6. Retwist copper strands by hand or with pliers, 
if necessary, to restore natural lay and tightness  
of strands.

A pair of handheld wire strippers is shown in Figure 9-151. 
This tool is commonly used to strip most types of wire. The
following general procedures describe the steps for stripping 
wire with a hand stripper.

1. Insert wire into exact center of correct cutting slot 
for wire size to be stripped. Each slot is marked with 
wire size.

2. Close handles together as far as they will go.

3. Release handles, allowing wire holder to return to the 
open position.

4. Remove stripped wire.
 

Terminals are attached to the ends of electrical wires to 
facilitate connection of the wires to terminal strips or items 
of equipment. [Figure 9-152] The tensile strength of the 
wire-to-terminal joint should be at least equivalent to the 
tensile strength of the wire itself, and its resistance negligible 
relative to the normal resistance of the wire.

The following should be considered in the selection of wire 
terminals: current rating, wire size (gauge) and insulation 
diameter, conductor material compatibility, stud size, 
insulation material compatibility, application environment, 
and solder versus solderless.

Figure 9-152. Ring-tongue terminals.

Figure 9-153. Terminal strip. 
Figure 9-154. Wire terminal.

Preinsulated crimp-type ring-tongue terminals are preferred. 
The strength, size, and supporting means of studs and 
binding posts, as well as the wire size, may be considered 
when determining the number of terminals to be attached 
to any one post. In high-temperature applications, the 
terminal temperature rating must be greater than the ambient 
temperature plus current related temperature rise. Use of 
nickel-plated terminals and of uninsulated terminals with 
high-temperature insulating sleeves should be considered. 
Terminal blocks should be provided with adequate electrical 
clearance or insulation strips between mounting hardware 
and conductive parts.

Terminal Strips
Wires are usually joined at terminal strips. [Figure 9-153] A 
terminal strip fitted with barriers may be used to prevent 
the terminals on adjacent studs from contacting each other. 
Studs should be anchored against rotation. When more than 
four terminals are to be connected together, a small metal bus 
should be mounted across two or more adjacent studs. In all 
cases, the current should be carried by the terminal contact 

surfaces and not by the stud itself. Defective studs should be 
replaced with studs of the same size and material since terminal 
strip studs of the smaller sizes may shear due to overtightening 
the nut. The replacement stud should be securely mounted in 
the terminal strip and the terminal securing nut should be tight. 
Terminal strips should be mounted in such a manner that loose 
metallic objects cannot fall across the terminals or studs. It 
is good practice to provide at least one spare stud for future 
circuit expansion or in case a stud is broken.

Terminal strips that provide connection of radio and 
electronic systems to the aircraft electrical system should 
be inspected for loose connections, metallic objects that 
may have fallen across the terminal strip, dirt and grease 
accumulation, etc. These conditions can cause arcing, which 
may result in a fire or system failures.

Terminal Lugs
Wire terminal lugs should be used to connect wiring to terminal 
block studs or equipment terminal studs. No more than four 
terminal lugs, or three terminal lugs and a bus bar, should be 
connected to any one stud. The total number of terminal lugs 
per stud includes a common bus bar joining adjacent studs. 
Four terminal lugs plus a common bus bar are not permitted 
on one stud. Terminal lugs should be selected with a stud 
hole diameter that matches the diameter of the stud. However, 
when the terminal lugs attached to a stud vary in diameter, 
the greatest diameter should be placed on the bottom and the 
smallest diameter on top. Tightening terminal connections 
should not deform the terminal lugs or the studs. Terminal lugs 
should be positioned so that bending of the terminal lug is not 
required to remove the fastening screw or nut, and movement 
of the terminal lugs tends to tighten the connection.

Copper Wire Terminals

Solderless crimp-style, copper wire, terminal lugs may be 
used which conform to MIL-T-7928. Spacers or washers 
should not be used between the tongues of terminal lugs. 
[Figure 9-154]


9-92

Figure 9-155. Terminal splices.

Figure 9-156. Crimping pliers. 

Figure 9-157. Junction boxes. 

Aluminum Wire Terminals

The aluminum terminal lugs should be crimped to aluminum 
wire only. The tongue of the aluminum terminal lugs, or the 
total number of tongues of aluminum terminal lugs when 
stacked, should be sandwiched between two flat washers 
when terminated on terminal studs. Spacers or washers 
should not be used between the tongues of terminal lugs. 
Special attention should be given to aluminum wire and cable 
installations to guard against conditions that would result in 
excessive voltage drop and high resistance at junctions that 
may ultimately lead to failure of the junction. Examples of 
such conditions are improper installation of terminals and 
washers, improper torsion (torquing of nuts), and inadequate 
terminal contact areas.

Pre-Insulated Splices

Pre-insulated terminal lugs and splices must be installed using 
a high-quality crimping tool. Such tools are provided with 
positioners for the wire size and are adjusted for each wire 
size. It is essential that the crimp depth be appropriate for 
each wire size. If the crimp is too deep, it may break or cut 
individual strands. If the crimp is not deep enough, it may not 
be tight enough to retain the wire in the terminal or connector. 
Crimps that are not tight enough are also susceptible to high 
resistance due to corrosion buildup between the crimped 
terminal and the wire. [Figure 9-155]

Crimping Tools

Hand, portable, and stationary power tools are available for 
crimping terminal lugs. These tools crimp the barrel to the 
conductor, and simultaneously form the insulation support 
to the wire insulation. [Figure 9-156]

Emergency Splicing Repairs
Broken wires can be repaired by means of crimped splices, 
by using terminal lugs from which the tongue has been cut 
off, or by soldering together and potting broken strands. 
These repairs are applicable to copper wire. Damaged 
aluminum wire must not be temporarily spliced. These 
repairs are for temporary emergency use only and should  

be replaced as soon as possible with permanent repairs. 
Since some manufacturers prohibit splicing, the applicable 
manufacturer’s instructions should always be consulted.

Junction Boxes 
Junction boxes are used for collecting, organizing, and 
distributing circuits to the appropriate harnesses that are 
attached to the equipment. [Figure 9-157] Junction boxes are 
also used to conveniently house miscellaneous components, 
such as relays and diodes. Junction boxes that are used in 
high-temperature areas should be made of stainless steel.


9-93

Figure 9-158. Electrical connectors. 

Replacement junction boxes should be fabricated using 
the same material as the original or from a fire-resistant, 
nonabsorbent material, such as aluminum, or an acceptable 
plastic material. Where fireproofing is necessary, a stainless 
steel junction box is recommended. Rigid construction 
prevents oil-canning of the box sides that could result in 
internal short circuits. In all cases, drain holes should be 
provided in the lowest portion of the box. Cases of electrical 
power equipment must be insulated from metallic structure 
to avoid ground fault related fires. 

The junction box arrangement should permit easy access to 
any installed items of equipment, terminals, and wires. Where 
marginal clearances are unavoidable, an insulating material 
should be inserted between current carrying parts and any 
grounded surface. It is not good practice to mount equipment 
on the covers or doors of junction boxes, since inspection 
for internal clearance is impossible when the door or cover 
is in the closed position.

Junction boxes should be securely mounted to the aircraft 
structure in such a manner that the contents are readily 
accessible for inspection. When possible, the open side 
should face downward or at an angle so that loose metallic 
objects, such as washers or nuts, tend to fall out of the junction 
box rather than wedge between terminals.

Junction box layouts should take into consideration the 
necessity for adequate wiring space and possible future 
additions. Electrical wire bundles should be laced or clamped 
inside the box so that cables do not touch other components, 
prevent ready access, or obscure markings or labels. Cables 
at entrance openings should be protected against chafing by 
using grommets or other suitable means.

AN/MS Connectors
Connectors (plugs and receptacles) facilitate maintenance 
when frequent disconnection is required. There is a multitude 
of types of connectors. The connector types that use crimped 
contacts are generally used on aircraft. Some of the more 
common types are the round cannon type, the rectangular, 
and the module blocks. Environmentally resistant connectors 
should be used in applications subject to fluids, vibration, 
heat, mechanical shock, and/or corrosive elements.

When HIRF/lightning protection is required, special 
attention should be given to the terminations of individual 
or overall shields. The number and complexity of wiring 
systems have resulted in an increased use of electrical 
connectors. [Figure 9-158] The proper choice and application 
of connectors is a significant part of the aircraft wiring 
system. Connectors must be kept to a minimum, selected, 
and installed to provide the maximum degree of safety and  

reliability to the aircraft. For the installation of any particular 
connector assembly, the specification of the manufacturer or 
the appropriate governing agency must be followed.

Types of Connector

Connectors must be identified by an original identification 
number derived from MIL Specification (MS) or OEM 
specification. Figure 9-159 provides information about MS 
style connectors.

Environment-resistant connectors are used in applications 
where they are probably subjected to fluids, vibration, heat, 
mechanical shock, corrosive elements, etc. Firewall class 
connectors incorporating these same features should, in 
addition, be able to prevent the penetration of the fire through 
the aircraft firewall connector opening and continue to 
function without failure for a specified period of time when 
exposed to fire. Hermetic connectors provide a pressure 
seal for maintaining pressurized areas. When EMI/RFI 
protection is required, special attention should be given to 
the termination of individual and overall shields. Backshell 
adapters designed for shield termination, connectors with 
conductive finishes, and EMI grounding fingers are available 
for this purpose.

Rectangular connectors are typically used in applications 
where a very large number of circuits are accommodated in 
a single mated pair. [Figure 9-160] They are available with a 
great variety of contacts, which can include a mix of standard, 
coaxial, and large power types. Coupling is accomplished by 
various means. Smaller types are secured with screws which 
hold their flanges together. Larger ones have integral guide 
pins that ensure correct alignment, or jackscrews that both 
align and lock the connectors. Rack and panel connectors 
use integral or rack-mounted pins for alignment and box 
mounting hardware for couplings.

Figure 9-159. MS connector information sheet. 

Module blocks are types of junctions that accept crimped 
contacts similar to those on connectors. Some use internal 
busing to provide a variety of circuit arrangements. They 
are useful where a number of wires are connected for power 
or signal distribution. When used as grounding modules, 
they save and reduce hardware installation on the aircraft. 

Standardized modules are available with wire end grommet 
seals for environmental applications and are track mounted. 
Function module blocks are used to provide an easily 
wired package for environment-resistant mounting of small 
resistors, diodes, filters, and suppression networks. In-line 
terminal junctions are sometimes used in lieu of a connector

when only a few wires are terminated and when the ability to 
disconnect the wires is desired. The in-line terminal junction 
is environment resistant. The terminal junction splice is 
small and may be tied to the surface of a wire bundle when 
approved by the OEM.

Voltage and Current Rating

Selected connectors must be rated for continuous operation 
under the maximum combination of ambient temperature 
and circuit current load. Hermetic connectors and connectors 
used in circuit applications involving high-inrush currents 
should be derated. It is good engineering practice to conduct 
preliminary testing in any situation where the connector 
is to operate with most or all of its contacts at maximum 
rated current load. When wiring is operating with a high 
conductor temperature near its rated temperature, connector 
contact sizes should be suitably rated for the circuit load. 
This may require an increase in wire size. Voltage derating 
is required when connectors are used at high altitude in 
nonpressurized areas. 

Spare Contacts for Future Wiring

To accommodate future wiring additions, spare contacts are 
normally provided. Locating the unwired contacts along 
the outer part of the connector facilitates future access. A 
good practice is to provide two spares on connectors with 
25 or fewer contacts; 4 spares on connectors with 26 to 
100 contacts; and 6 spares on connectors with more than 
100 contacts. Spare contacts are not normally provided on 
receptacles of components that are unlikely to have added 
wiring. Connectors must have all available contact cavities 
filled with wired or unwired contacts. Unwired contacts 
should be provided with a plastic grommet sealing plug.

Wire Installation into the Connector

Wires that perform the same function in redundant systems 
must be routed through separate connectors. On systems 
critical to flight safety, system operation wiring should be 
routed through separate connectors from the wiring used 
for system failure warning. It is also good practice to route 
a system’s indication wiring in separate connectors from its 
failure warning circuits to the extent practicable. These steps 
can reduce an aircraft’s susceptibility to incidents that might 
result from connector failures.

Adjacent Locations

Mating of adjacent connectors should not be possible. In order 
to ensure this, adjacent connector pairs must be different in 
shell size, coupling means, insert arrangement, or keying 
arrangement. When such means are impractical, wires should 
be routed and clamped so that incorrectly mated pairs cannot 
reach each other. Reliance on markings or color stripes 
is not recommended as they are likely to deteriorate with  
age. [Figure 9-161]

Sealing

Connectors must be of a type that excludes moisture entry 
through the use of peripheral and interfacial seal that are 
compressed when the connector is mated. Moisture entry 
through the rear of the connector must be avoided by 
correctly matching the wire’s outside diameter with the 
connector’s rear grommet sealing range. It is recommended 
that no more than one wire be terminated in any crimp style 
contact. The use of heat-shrinkable tubing to build up the 
wire diameter, or the application of potting to the wire entry 
area as additional means of providing a rear compatibility 


9-96

Figure 9-162. Backshells with strain relief.

Figure 9-163. Coaxial cables. 

with the rear grommet is recommended. These extra means 
have inherent penalties and should be considered only where 
other means cannot be used. Unwired spare contacts should 
have a correctly sized plastic plug installed.

Drainage

Connectors must be installed in a manner that ensures 
moisture and fluids drain out of and not into the connector 
when unmated. Wiring must be routed so that moisture 
accumulated on the bundle drains away from connectors. 
When connectors must be mounted in a vertical position, 
as through a shelf or floor, the connectors must be potted or 
environmentally sealed. In this situation, it is better to have 
the receptacle faced downward so that it is less susceptible 
to collecting moisture when unmated.

Wire Support 

A rear accessory back shell must be used on connectors that 
are not enclosed. Connectors with very small size wiring, or 
subject to frequent maintenance activity, or located in high-
vibration areas must be provided with a strain-relief-type back 
shell. The wire bundle should be protected from mechanical 
damage with suitable cushion material where it is secured 
by the clamp. Connectors that are potted or have molded 
rear adapters do not normally use a separate strain relief 
accessory. Strain relief clamps should not impart tension on 
wires between the clamp and contact. [Figure 9-162]

Sufficient wire length must be provided at connectors to 
ensure a proper drip loop and that there is no strain on 
termination after a complete replacement of the connector 
and its contacts.

Coaxial Cable
All wiring needs to be protected from damage. However, 
coaxial and triaxial cables are particularly vulnerable to 
certain types of damage. Personnel should exercise care while 
handling or working around coaxial. [Figure 9-163] Coaxial 

damage can occur when clamped too tightly, or when they are 
bent sharply (normally at or near connectors). Damage can 
also be incurred during unrelated maintenance actions around 
the coaxial cable. Coaxial cable can be severely damaged on 
the inside without any evidence of damage on the outside. 
Coaxial cables with solid center conductors should not be 
used. Stranded center coaxial cables can be used as a direct 
replacement for solid center coaxial. [Figure 9-164] Coaxial 
cable precautions include:

• Never kink coaxial cable.

• Never drop anything on coaxial cable.

• Never step on coaxial cable.

• Never bend coaxial cable sharply.

• Never loop coaxial cable tighter than the allowable 
bend radius.

• Never pull on coaxial cable except in a straight line.

• Never use coaxial cable for a handle, lean on it, or 
hang things on it (or any other wire).

Wire Inspection
Aircraft service imposes severe environmental condition on 
electrical wire. To ensure satisfactory service, inspect wire 
annually for abrasions, defective insulation, condition of 
terminations, and potential corrosion. Grounding connections 
for power, distribution equipment, and electromagnetic 
shielding must be given particular attention to ensure that 
electrical bonding resistance has not been significantly 
increased by the loosening of connections or corrosion.

Electrical System Components
Switches
Switches are devices that open and close circuits. They 
consist of one or more pair of contacts. The current in the 
circuit flows when the contacts are closed. Switches with

momentary contacts actuate the circuit temporarily, and they 
return to the normal position with an internal spring when 
the switch is released. Switches with continuous contacts 
remain in position when activated. Hazardous errors in 
switch operation can be avoided by logical and consistent 
installation. Two-position on/off switches should be mounted 

so that the on position is reached by an upward or forward 
movement of the toggle. When the switch controls movable 
aircraft elements, such as landing gear or flaps, the toggle 
should move in the same direction as the desired motion. 
Inadvertent operation of a switch can be prevented by 
mounting a suitable guard over the switch. [Figure 9-165]

Figure 9-166. Derating table for switches.

A specifically designed switch should be used in all circuits 
where a switch malfunction would be hazardous. Such 
switches are of rugged construction and have sufficient 
contact capacity to break, make, and carry continuously 
the connected load current. Snap action design is generally 
preferred to obtain rapid opening and closing of contacts 
regardless of the speed of the operating toggle or plunger, 
thereby minimizing contact arcing. The nominal current 
rating of the conventional aircraft switch is usually stamped 
on the switch housing. This rating represents the continuous 
current rating with the contacts closed. Switches should be 
derated from their nominal current rating for the following 
types of circuits:

1. High rush-in circuits—contain incandescent lamps 
that can draw an initial current 15 times greater than 
the continuous current. Contact burning or welding 
may occur when the switch is closed.

2. Inductive circuits—magnetic energy stored in solenoid 
coils or relays is released and appears as an arc when 
the control switch is opened.

3. Motors—DC motors draw several times their rated 
current during starting, and magnetic energy stored 
in their armature and field coils is released when the 
control switch is opened.

Figure 9-166 is used for selecting the proper nominal switch 
rating when the continuous load current is known. This 
selection is essentially a derating to obtain reasonable switch 
efficiency and service life. 

Type of Switches
Single-pole single-throw (SPST)—opens and closes a single 
circuit. Pole indicates the number of separate circuits that can 
be activated, and throw indicates the number of current paths. 
 
Double-pole single-throw (DPST)—turn two circuits on and 
off with one lever. 
 
Single-pole double-throw (SPDT)—route circuit current to 
either of two paths. The switch is ON in both positions. For 
example, switch turns on red lamp in one position and turns 
on green lamp in the other position. 

Double-pole double-throw (DPDT)—activates two separate 
circuits at the same time. 

Double-throw switches—have either two or three positions.

Two-position switch—pole always connected to one of the 
two throws. Three-position switches have a center OFF 
position that disconnects the pole from both throws.

Spring-loaded switches—available in two types: 1) normally 
open (NO) and 2) normally closed (NC). The contacts of 
the NO switch are disconnected in the normal position and 
become closed when the switch is activated. The switch 
returns to the normal position when the applied force to 
the switch is released. The contacts of the NC switch are 
connected in the normal position and become open when the 
switch is activated. The switch returns to the normal position 
when the applied force to the switch is released.

Toggle and Rocker Switches
Toggle and rocker switches control most of aircraft’s 
electrical components. [Figure 9-167] Aircraft that are

outfitted with a glass cockpit often use push buttons to control 
electrical components.

Rotary Switches
Rotary switches are activated by twisting a knob or shaft and 
are commonly found on radio control panels. Rotary switches 
are utilized for controlling more than two circuits. 

Precision (Micro) Switches
Micro switches require very little pressure to activate. These 
types of switches are spring loaded, once the pressure is 
removed, the contacts return to the normal position. These 
types of switches are typically single pole double throw 
(SPDT) or double pole double throw (DPDT) and have three 
contacts: normally open, normally closed, and common. 
Micro switches are used to detect position or to limit travel 
of moving parts, such as landing gear, flaps, spoilers, etc. 
[Figure 9-168]

Relays and Solenoids (Electromagnetic Switches)
Relays are used to control the flow of large currents using a 
small current. A low-power DC circuit is used to activate the 

relay and control the flow of large AC currents. They are used 
to switch motors and other electrical equipment on and off 
and to protect them from overheating. A solenoid is a special 
type of relay that has a moving core. The electromagnet core 
in a relay is fixed. Solenoids are mostly used as mechanical 
actuators but can also be used for switching large currents. 
Relays are only used to switch currents. 

Solenoids
Solenoids are used as switching devices where a weight 
reduction can be achieved or electrical controls can be 
simplified. The foregoing discussion of switch ratings is 
generally applicable to solenoid contact ratings. Solenoids 
have a movable core/armature that is usually made of steel 
or iron, and the coil is wrapped around the armature. The 
solenoid has an electromagnetic tube and the armature moves 
in and out of the tube. [Figure 9-169]

Relays
The two main types of relays are electromechanical and 
solid state. Electromechanical relays have a fixed core and 
a moving plate with contacts on it, while solid-state relays 
work similar to transistors and have no moving parts. Current 
flowing through the coil of an electromechanical relay creates 
a magnetic field that attracts a lever and changes the switch

contacts. The coil current can be on or off so relays have 
two switch positions, and they are double throw switches. 
Residual magnetism is a common problem and the contacts 
may stay closed or are opened by a slight amount of residual 
magnetism. A relay is an electrically operated switch and 
is therefore subject to dropout under low system voltage 
conditions. Relays allow one circuit to switch a second circuit 
that can be completely separate from the first. For example, 
a low voltage DC battery circuit can use a relay to switch 
a 110-volt three-phase AC circuit. There is no electrical 
connection inside the relay between the two circuits; the link 
is magnetic and mechanical. [Figure 9-170]

Current Limiting Devices
Conductors should be protected with circuit breakers or fuses 
located as close as possible to the electrical power source 
bus. Normally, the manufacturer of the electrical equipment 
specifies the fuse or circuit breaker to be used when installing 
equipment. The circuit breaker or fuse should open the circuit 
before the conductor emits smoke. To accomplish this, the 
time current characteristic of the protection device must fall 
below that of the associated conductor. Circuit protector 
characteristics should be matched to obtain the maximum 
utilization of the connected equipment. Figure 9-171 shows a 
chart used in selecting the circuit breaker and fuse protection 
for copper conductors. This limited chart is applicable to a 
specific set of ambient temperatures and wire bundle sizes 
and is presented as typical only. It is important to consult such 
guides before selecting a conductor for a specific purpose. 
For example, a wire run individually in the open air may be 
protected by the circuit breaker of the next higher rating to 
that shown on the chart.

Fuses
A fuse is placed in series with the voltage source and all 
current must flow through it. [Figure 9-172] The fuse consists 
of a strip of metal that is enclosed in a glass or plastic housing. 
The metal strip has a low melting point and is usually made 

of lead, tin, or copper. When the current exceeds the capacity 
of the fuse the metal strip heats up and breaks. As a result of 
this, the flow of current in the circuit stops.

There are two basic types of fuses: fast acting and slow 
blow. The fast-acting type opens very quickly when their 
particular current rating is exceeded. This is important for 
electric devices that can quickly be destroyed when too much 
current flows through them for even a very small amount 
of time. Slow blow fuses have a coiled construction inside. 
They are designed to open only on a continued overload, 
such as a short circuit.

Circuit Breakers
A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical 
switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage 
caused by an overload or short circuit. Its basic function 
is to detect a fault condition and immediately discontinue 
electrical flow. Unlike a fuse that operates once and then has 
to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset to resume normal 
operation. All resettable circuit breakers should open the 
circuit in which they are installed regardless of the position of 
the operating control when an overload or circuit fault exists. 
Such circuit breakers are referred to as trip-free. Automatic

light.

Figure 9-175. A right wing tip position light, also known as a 
navigation light. 

reset circuit breakers automatically reset themselves. They 
should not be used as circuit protection devices in aircraft. 
When a circuit breaker trips, the electrical circuit should be 
checked and the fault removed before the circuit breaker 
is reset. Sometimes circuit breakers trip for no apparent 
reason, and the circuit breaker can be reset one time. If the 
circuit breaker trips again, there exists a circuit fault and the 
technician must troubleshoot the circuit before resetting the 
circuit breaker. [Figure 9-173]

Some new aircraft designs use a digital circuit protection 
architecture. This system monitors the amperage through 
a particular circuit. When the maximum amperage for that 
circuit is reached, the power is rerouted away from the circuit. 
This system reduces the use of mechanical circuit breakers. 
The advantages are weight savings and the reduction of 
mechanical parts.

Aircraft Lighting Systems
Aircraft lighting systems provide illumination for both exterior 
and interior use. Lights on the exterior provide illumination 
for such operations as landing at night, inspection of icing 
conditions, and safety from midair collision. Interior lighting 
provides illumination for instruments, cockpits, cabins, and 
other sections occupied by crewmembers and passengers. 
Certain special lights, such as indicator and warning lights, 
indicate the operation status of equipment.

Exterior Lights
Position, anticollision, landing, and taxi lights are common 
examples of aircraft exterior lights. Some lights are required 
for night operations. Other types of exterior lights, such as 
wing inspection lights, are of great benefit for specialized 
flying operations.

Position Lights
Aircraft operating at night must be equipped with position 
lights that meet the minimum requirements specified by Title 
14 of the Code of Federal Regulations. A set of position 
lights consist of one red, one green, and one white light. 
[Figures 9-174 and 9-175]

On some types of installations, a switch in the cockpit 
provides for steady or flashing operation of the position 
lights. On many aircraft, each light unit contains a single lamp 
mounted on the surface of the aircraft. Other types of position 
light units contain two lamps and are often streamlined into 
the surface of the aircraft structure. The green light unit is 
always mounted at the extreme tip of the right wing. The red 
unit is mounted in a similar position on the left wing. The

white unit is usually located on the vertical stabilizer in a 
position where it is clearly visible through a wide angle from 
the rear of the aircraft. Figure 9-176 illustrates a schematic 
diagram of a position light circuit. Position lights are also 
known as navigation lights.

There are, of course, many variations in the position light 
circuits used on different aircraft. All circuits are protected by 
fuses or circuit breakers, and many circuits include flashing 
and dimming equipment. Small aircraft are usually equipped 
with a simplified control switch and circuitry. In some cases, 
one control knob or switch is used to turn on several sets 
of lights; for example, one type utilizes a control knob, the 
first movement of which turns on the position lights and the 
instrument panel lights. Further rotation of the control knob 
increases the intensity of only the panel lights. A flasher unit 
is seldom included in the position light circuitry of very light 
aircraft but is used in small twin-engine aircraft. Traditional 
position lights use incandescent light bulbs. LED lights have 
been introduced on modern aircraft because of their good 
visibility, high reliability, and low power consumption.

Anticollision Lights
An anticollision light system may consist of one or more 
lights. They are rotating beam lights that are usually installed 
on top of the fuselage or tail in such a location that the light 
does not affect the vision of the crewmember or detract from 
the visibility of the position lights. Large transport type 
aircraft use an anticollision light on top and one on the bottom 

of the aircraft. Figure 9-177 shows a typical anticollision 
light installation in a vertical stabilizer.


9-103

Figure 9-178. Landing lights.
Figure 9-179. Taxi lights.

An anticollision light unit usually consists of one or two 
rotating lights operated by an electric motor. The light may be 
fixed but mounted under rotating mirrors inside a protruding 
red glass housing. The mirrors rotate in an arc, and the 
resulting flash rate is between 40 and 100 cycles per minute. 
Newer aircraft designs use a LED type of anticollision light. 
The anticollision light is a safety light to warn other aircraft, 
especially in congested areas.

A white strobe light is a second type of anti-collision light 
that is also common. Usually mounted at the wing tips and, 
possibly, at empennage extremities, strobe lights produce an 
extremely bright intermittent flash of white light that is highly 
visible. The light is produced by a high voltage discharge of a 
capacitor. A dedicated power pack houses the capacitor and 
supplies voltage to a sealed xenon-filled tube. The xenon 
ionizes with a flash when the voltage is applied. A strobe 
light is shown in Figure 9-174.

Landing and Taxi Lights
Landing lights are installed in aircraft to illuminate runways 
during night landings. These lights are very powerful and 
are directed by a parabolic reflector at an angle providing a 
maximum range of illumination. Landing lights of smaller 
aircraft are usually located midway in the leading edge of 
each wing or streamlined into the aircraft surface. Landing 
lights for larger transport category aircraft are usually located 
in the leading edge of the wing close to the fuselage. Each 
light may be controlled by a relay, or it may be connected 
directly into the electric circuit. On some aircraft, the 
landing light is mounted in the same area with a taxi light. 
[Figure 9-178] A sealed beam, halogen, or high intensity 
xenon discharge lamp is used.

Taxi lights are designed to provide illumination on the ground 
while taxiing or towing the aircraft to or from a runway, taxi 

strip, or in the hangar area. [Figure 9-179] Taxi lights are 
not designed to provide the degree of illumination necessary 
for landing lights. On aircraft with tricycle landing gear, 
either single or multiple taxi lights are often mounted on 
the non-steerable part of the nose landing gear. They are 
positioned at an oblique angle to the center line of the aircraft 
to provide illumination directly in front of the aircraft and 
also some illumination to the right and left of the aircraft’s 
path. On some aircraft, the dual taxi lights are supplemented 
by wingtip clearance lights controlled by the same circuitry. 
Taxi lights are also mounted in the recessed areas of the wing 
leading edge, often in the same area with a fixed landing light. 
Many small aircraft are not equipped with any type of taxi 
light, but rely on the intermittent use of a landing light to

illuminate taxiing operations. Still other aircraft utilize 
a dimming resistor in the landing light circuit to provide 
reduced illumination for taxiing. A typical circuit for taxi 
lights is shown in Figure 9-180.

Some large aircraft are equipped with alternate taxi lights 
located on the lower surface of the aircraft, aft of the nose 
radome. These lights, operated by a separate switch from the 
main taxi lights, illuminate the area immediately in front of 
and below the aircraft nose.

Wing Inspection Lights
Some aircraft are equipped with wing inspection lights to 
illuminate the leading edge of the wings to permit observation 
of icing and general condition of these areas in flight. 
These lights permit visual detection of ice formation on 
wing leading edges while flying at night. They are usually 
controlled through a relay by an on/off toggle switch in the 
cockpit. Some wing inspection light systems may include 
or be supplemented by additional lights, sometimes called 
nacelle lights, that illuminate adjacent areas, such a cowl 
flaps or the landing gear. These are normally the same type 
of lights and can be controlled by the same circuits.

Interior Lights
Aircraft are equipped with interior lights to illuminate the 
cabin. [Figure 9-181] Often white and red light settings are 
provided. Commercial aircraft have a lighting systems that 
illuminates the main cabin, an independent lighting system 
so that passengers can read when the cabin lights are off, and 
an emergency lighting system on the floor of the aircraft to 
aid passengers of the aircraft during an emergency. 


9-105

Maintenance and Inspection of Lighting Systems
Inspection of an aircraft’s lighting system normally includes 
checking the condition and security of all visible wiring, 
connections, terminals, fuses, and switches. A continuity 
light or meter can be used in making these checks, since the 
cause of many troubles can often be located by systematically 
testing each circuit for continuity.

Preface
The Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook—Airframe  (FAA-H-8083-31A) is one of a series of three handbooks 
for persons preparing for certification as an airframe or powerplant mechanic. It is intended that this handbook provide the 
basic information on principles, fundamentals, and technical procedures in the subject matter areas relating to the airframe 
rating. It is designed to aid students enrolled in a formal course of instruction, as well as the individual who is studying on 
his or her own. Since the knowledge requirements for the airframe and powerplant ratings closely parallel each other in 
some subject areas, the chapters which discuss fire protection systems and electrical systems contain some material which 
is also duplicated in the Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook—Powerplant (FAA-H-8083-32A).

This volume contains information on airframe construction features, assembly and rigging, fabric covering, structural repairs, 
and aircraft welding. The handbook also contains an explanation of the units that make up the various airframe systems. 
Because there are so many different types of aircraft in use today, it is reasonable to expect that differences exist in airframe 
components and systems. To avoid undue repetition, the practice of using representative systems and units is carried out 
throughout the handbook. Subject matter treatment is from a generalized point of view and should be supplemented by 
reference to manufacturer's manuals or other textbooks if more detail is desired. This handbook is not intended to replace, 
substitute for, or supersede official regulations or the manufacturer’s instructions. Occasionally the word “must” or similar 
language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, 
or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from www.faa.gov.

The subject of Human Factors is contained in the Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook—General (FAA-H-8083-30).
